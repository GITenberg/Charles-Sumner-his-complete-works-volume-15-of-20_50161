<p>Late in the evening of Friday, March 29, 1867, Mr. Sumner, on reaching
home, found this note from Mr. Seward awaiting him: “Can you
come to my house this evening? I have a matter of public business
in regard to which it is desirable that I should confer with you at
once.” Without delay he hurried to the house of the Secretary of
State, only to find that the latter had left for the Department. His
son, the Assistant Secretary, was at home, and he was soon joined
by Mr. de Stoeckl, the Russian Minister. From the two Mr. Sumner
learned for the first time that a treaty was about to be signed for the
cession of Russian America to the United States. With a map in his
hand, the Minister, who had just returned from St. Petersburg, explained
the proposed boundary, according to verbal instructions from
the Archduke Constantine. After a brief conversation, when Mr.
Sumner inquired and listened without expressing any opinion, they
left together, the Minister on his way to the Department, where the
treaty was copying. The clock was striking midnight as they parted,
the Minister saying with interest, “You will not fail us.” The treaty
was signed about four o’clock in the morning of March 30th, being
the last day of the current session of Congress, and on the same day
transmitted to the Senate, and referred to the Committee on Foreign
Relations.</p>

<p>April 1st, the Senate was convened in Executive session by the
proclamation of the President of the United States, and the Committee
proceeded to the consideration of the treaty. The Committee
at the time was Messrs. Sumner (Chairman), Fessenden, of Maine,
Cameron, of Pennsylvania, Harlan, of Iowa, Morton, of Indiana, Patterson,
of New Hampshire, and Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland. Carefully
and anxiously they considered the question, and meanwhile it
was discussed outside. Among friendly influences was a strong pressure
from Hon. Thaddeus Stevens, the acknowledged leader of the other
House, who, though without constitutional voice on the ratification of
a treaty, could not restrain his earnest testimony. Mr. Sumner was
controlled less by desire for more territory than by a sense of the
amity of Russia, manifested especially during our recent troubles, and
by an unwillingness to miss the opportunity of dismissing another
European sovereign from our continent, predestined, as he believed,
to become the broad, undivided home of the American people; and
these he developed in his remarks before the Senate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>April 8th, the treaty was reported by Mr. Sumner without amendment,
and with the recommendation that the Senate advise and consent
thereto. The next day it was considered, when Mr. Sumner spoke
on the negotiation, its origin, and the character of the ceded possessions.
A motion by Mr. Fessenden to postpone its further consideration
was voted down,&mdash;Yeas 12, Nays 29. After further debate, the
final question of ratification was put and carried on the same day by
a vote of Yeas 37, Nays 2,&mdash;the Nays being Mr. Fessenden, and
Mr. Morrill, of Vermont. The ratifications were exchanged June 20th,
and the same day the treaty was proclaimed.</p>

<p>The debate was in Executive session, and no reporters were present.
Senators interested in the question invited Mr. Sumner to write out
his remarks and give them to the public. For some time he hesitated,
but, taking advantage of the vacation, he applied himself to
the work, following precisely in order and subdivision the notes of
a single page from which he spoke.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The speech was noticed at home and abroad. At home, the Boston
<i>Journal</i>, which published it at length, remarked:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This speech, it will be remembered, coming from the Chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Affairs, and abounding in a mass of pertinent information
not otherwise accessible to Senators, exerted a most marked,
if not decisive, effect in favor of the ratification of the treaty. Since then,
the rumors of Mr. Sumner’s exhaustive treatment of the subject, together
with the increasing popular interest in our new territory, have stimulated
a general desire for the publication of the speech, which we are now enabled
to supply. As might be expected, the speech is a monument of
comprehensive research, and of skill in the collection and arrangement of
facts. It probably comprises about all the information that is extant concerning
our new Pacific possessions, and will prove equally interesting to
the student of history, the politician, and the man of business.”</p>

</div>

<p>A Russian translation, by Mr. Buynitzky, appeared at St. Petersburg,
with an introduction, whose complimentary character is manifest
in its opening:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Senator Charles Sumner, of Massachusetts, appears, since the election
of Lincoln, as one of the most eloquent and conspicuous representatives
of the Republican party. His name stands in the first rank of the
zealous propagators of Abolitionism, and all his political activity is directed
toward one object,&mdash;the completion of the glorious act of enfranchisement
of five millions of citizens by a series of laws calculated to
secure to freedmen the actual possession of civil and political rights. As
Chairman of the Senate Committee upon Foreign Relations, Mr. Sumner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>attentively watches the march of affairs in Europe generally; but, in the
course of the present decade, his particular attention was attracted by the
reforms which took place in Russia. The emancipation of the peasants
in our country was viewed with the liveliest sympathy by the American
statesman, and this sympathy expressed itself eloquently in his speeches,
delivered on various occasions, as well in Congress as in the State conventions
of Massachusetts.”</p>

</div>

<p>A French writer, M. Cochin, whose work on Slavery is an important
contribution to the literature of Emancipation, in a later
work thus characterizes this speech:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All that is known on Russian America has just been presented in a
speech, abundant, erudite, eloquent, poetic, pronounced before the Congress
of the United States by the great orator, Charles Sumner.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On the appearance of the speech, May 24th, Professor Baird, the accomplished
naturalist of the Smithsonian Institution, wrote, expressing
the hope that some Boston or New York publisher would reprint what
he called the “Essay” in a “book-form,” adding: “It deserves some
more permanent dress than that of a speech from the <i>Globe</i> office.”
This is done for the first time in the present publication.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These few notices, taken from many, are enough to show the contemporary
reception of the speech.</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<h3>SPEECH.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;You have just listened to the
reading of the treaty by which Russia cedes to
the United States all her possessions on the North
American continent and the adjacent islands in consideration
of $7,200,000 to be paid by the United States.
On the one side is the cession of a vast country, with
its jurisdiction and resources of all kinds; on the other
side is the purchase-money. Such is the transaction
on its face.</p>

<h4>BOUNDARIES AND CONFIGURATION.</h4>

<p>In endeavoring to estimate its character, I am glad to
begin with what is clear and beyond question. I refer
to the boundaries fixed by the treaty. Commencing at
the parallel of 54° 40´ north latitude, so famous in our
history, the line ascends Portland Canal to the mountains,
which it follows on their summits to the point of
intersection with the meridian of 141° west longitude,
which it ascends to the Frozen Ocean, or, if you please,
to the north pole. This is the eastern boundary, separating
the region from the British possessions, and it
is borrowed from the treaty between Russia and Great
Britain in 1825, establishing the relations between these
two powers on this continent. It is seen that this
boundary is old; the rest is new. Starting from the
Frozen Ocean, the western boundary descends Behring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Strait, midway between the two islands of Krusenstern
and Ratmanoff, to the parallel of 65° 30´, just below
where the continents of America and Asia approach
each other the nearest; and from this point it proceeds
in a course nearly southwest through Behring Strait,
midway between the island of St. Lawrence and Cape
Chukotski, to the meridian of 172° west longitude, and
thence, in a southwesterly direction, traversing Behring
Sea, midway between the island of Attoo on the east
and Copper Island on the west, to the meridian of
193° west longitude, leaving the prolonged group of
the Aleutian Islands in the possessions transferred to
the United States, and making the western boundary
of our country the dividing line which separates Asia
from America.</p>

<p>Look at the map and observe the configuration of
this extensive region, whose estimated area is more
than five hundred and seventy thousand square miles.
I speak by authority of our own Coast Survey. Including
the Sitkan Archipelago at the south, it takes a
margin of the main-land fronting on the ocean thirty
miles broad and five hundred miles long to Mount
St. Elias, the highest peak of the continent, when it
turns with an elbow to the west, and along Behring
Strait northerly, then rounding to the east along the
Frozen Ocean. Here are upwards of four thousand
statute miles of coast, indented by capacious bays and
commodious harbors without number, embracing the
peninsula of Alaska, one of the most remarkable in the
world, twenty-five miles in breadth and three hundred
miles in length; piled with mountains, many volcanic
and some still smoking; penetrated by navigable rivers,
one of which is among the largest of the world; studded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
with islands standing like sentinels on the coast, and
flanked by that narrow Aleutian range which, starting
from Alaska, stretches far away to Kamtchatka, as if
America were extending a friendly hand to Asia. This
is the most general aspect. There are details specially
disclosing maritime advantages and approaches to the
sea which properly belong to this preliminary sketch.
According to accurate estimate, the coast line, including
bays and islands, is not less than eleven thousand two
hundred and seventy miles. In the Aleutian range, besides
innumerable islets and rocks, there are not less
than fifty-five islands exceeding three miles in length;
there are seven exceeding forty miles, with Oonimak,
which is the largest, exceeding seventy-three miles.
In our part of Behring Sea there are five considerable
islands, the largest of which is St. Lawrence, being
more than ninety-six miles long. Add to all these the
group south of the peninsula of Alaska, including the
Shumagins and the magnificent island of Kadiak, and
then the Sitkan group, being archipelago added to archipelago,
and the whole together constituting the geographical
complement to the West Indies, so that the
northwest of the continent answers to the southeast,
archipelago for archipelago.</p>

<h4>DISCOVERY OF RUSSIAN AMERICA BY BEHRING, UNDER
INSTRUCTIONS FROM PETER THE GREAT.</h4>

<p>The title of Russia to all these possessions is derived
from prior discovery, being the admitted title by
which all European powers have held in North and
South America, unless we except what England acquired
by conquest from France; but here the title<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of France was derived from prior discovery. Russia,
shut up in a distant interior and struggling with barbarism,
was scarcely known to the other powers at the
time they were lifting their flags in the western hemisphere.
At a later day the same powerful genius which
made her known as an empire set in motion the enterprise
by which these possessions were opened to her dominion.
Peter, called the Great, himself ship-builder and
reformer, who had worked in the ship-yards of England
and Holland, was curious to know if Asia and America
were separated by the sea, or if they constituted one
undivided body with different names, like Europe and
Asia. To obtain this information, he wrote with his
own hand the following instructions, and ordered his
chief admiral to see them carried into execution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One or two boats with decks to be built at Kamtchatka,
or at any other convenient place, with which inquiry
should be made in relation to the northerly coasts, to
see whether they were not contiguous with America, since
their end was not known. And this done, they should see
whether they could not somewhere find an harbor belonging
to Europeans or an European ship. They should likewise
set apart some men who were to inquire after the name
and situation of the coasts discovered. Of all this an exact
journal should be kept, with which they should return to
Petersburg.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Czar died in the winter of 1725; but the Empress
Catharine, faithful to the desires of her husband,
did not allow this work to be neglected. Vitus Behring,
Dane by birth, and navigator of experience, was
made commander. The place of embarkation was on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the other side of the Asiatic continent. Taking with
him officers and ship-builders, the navigator left St.
Petersburg by land, 5th February, 1725, and commenced
the preliminary journey across Siberia, Northern Asia,
and the Sea of Okhotsk, to the coast of Kamtchatka,
which they reached only after infinite hardships and
delays, sometimes with dogs for horses, and sometimes
supporting life by eating leather bags, straps, and shoes.
More than three years were consumed in this toilsome
and perilous journey. At last, on the 20th of July,
1728, the party was able to set sail in a small vessel,
called the Gabriel, and described as “like the packet-boats
used in the Baltic.” Steering in a northeasterly
direction, Behring passed a large island, which he
called St. Lawrence, from the saint on whose day it
was seen. This island, which is included in the present
cession, may be considered as the first point in
Russian discovery, as it is also the first outpost of the
North American continent. Continuing northward, and
hugging the Asiatic coast, Behring turned back only
when he thought he had reached the northeastern extremity
of Asia, and was satisfied that the two continents
were separated from each other. He did not penetrate
further north than 67° 30´.</p>

<p>In his voyage Behring was struck by the absence of
such great and high waves as in other places are common
to the open sea, and he observed fir-trees swimming
in the water, although they were unknown on
the Asiatic coast. Relations of inhabitants, in harmony
with these indications, pointed to “a country at
no great distance towards the east.” His work was
still incomplete, and the navigator, before returning
home, put forth again for this discovery, but without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
success. By another dreary land journey he made his
way back to St. Petersburg in March, 1730, after an
absence of five years. Something was accomplished for
Russian discovery, and his own fame was engraved on
the maps of the world. The strait through which he
sailed now bears his name, as also does the expanse of
sea he traversed on his way to the strait.</p>

<p>The spirit of discovery continued at St. Petersburg.
A Cossack chief, undertaking to conquer the obstinate
natives on the northeastern coast, proposed also “to
discover the pretended country in the Frozen Sea.” He
was killed by an arrow before his enterprise was completed.
Little is known of the result; but it is stated
that the navigator whom he had selected, by name
Gwosdeff, in 1730 succeeded in reaching “a strange
coast” between sixty-five and sixty-six degrees of north
latitude, where he saw people, but could not speak with
them for want of an interpreter. This must have been
the coast of North America, and not far from the group
of islands in Behring Strait, through which the present
boundary passes, separating the United States from
Russia, and America from Asia.</p>

<p>The Russian desire to get behind the curtain increased.
Behring volunteered to undertake the discoveries
yet remaining. He was created Commodore, and
his old lieutenants were created captains. The Senate,
the Admiralty, and the Academy of Sciences at St.
Petersburg, all united in the enterprise. Several academicians
were appointed to report on the natural history
of the coasts visited, among whom was Steller,
the naturalist, said to be “immortal” from this association.
All of these, with a numerous body of officers,
journeyed across Siberia, Northern Asia, and the Sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of Okhotsk, to Kamtchatka, as Behring had journeyed
before. Though ordered in 1732, the expedition was
not able to leave the eastern coast until 4th June,
1741, when two well-appointed ships set sail in company
“to discover the continent of America.” One of
these, called the St. Peter, was under Commodore Behring;
the other, called the St. Paul, was under Captain
Tschirikoff. For some time the two kept together, but
in a violent storm and fog they were separated, when
each continued the expedition alone.</p>

<p>Behring first saw the continent of North America
18th July, 1741, in latitude 58° 28´. Looking at it from
a distance, “the country had terrible high mountains
that were covered with snow.” Two days later, he anchored
in a sheltered bay near a point, which he called,
from the saint’s day on which he saw it, Cape St. Elias.
He was in the shadow of Mount St. Elias. Landing,
he found deserted huts, fireplaces, hewn wood, household
furniture, arrows, “a whetstone on which it appeared
that copper knives had been sharpened,” and
“store of red salmon.” Here also birds unknown in Siberia
were noticed by the faithful Steller, among which
was the blue-jay, of a peculiar species, now called by
his name. At this point, Behring found himself constrained
by the elbow in the coast to turn westward,
and then in a southerly direction. Hugging the shore,
his voyage was constantly arrested by islands without
number, among which he zigzagged to find his way.
Several times he landed. Once he saw natives, who
wore “upper garments of whales’ guts, breeches of seal-skins,
and caps of the skins of sea-lions, adorned with
various feathers, especially those of hawks.” These
“Americans,” as they are called, were fishermen, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
bows and arrows. They regaled the Russians with
“whale’s flesh,” but declined strong drink. One of
them, on receiving a cup of brandy, “spit the brandy
out again as soon as he had tasted it, and cried aloud,
as if he was complaining to his countrymen how ill he
had been used.” This was on one of the Shumagin
Islands, near the southern coast of the peninsula of
Alaska.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the other solitary ship, proceeding on its
way, had sighted the same coast 15th July, 1741, in the
latitude of 56°. Anchoring at some distance from the
steep and rocky cliffs before him, Tschirikoff sent his
mate with the long-boat and ten of his best men, provided
with small-arms and a brass cannon, to inquire
into the nature of the country and to obtain fresh water.
The long-boat disappeared behind a headland, and was
never seen again. Thinking it might have been damaged
in landing, the captain sent his boatswain with
the small boat and carpenters, well armed, to furnish
necessary assistance. The small boat disappeared also,
and was never seen again. At the same time a great
smoke was observed continually ascending from the
shore. Shortly afterwards, two boats filled with natives
sallied forth and lay at some distance from the vessel,
when, crying, “<i>Agai, Agai</i>,” they put back to the
shore. Sorrowfully the Russian navigator turned away,
not knowing the fate of his comrades, and unable to
help them. This was not far from Sitka.</p>

<p>Such was the first discovery of these northwestern
coasts, and such are the first recorded glimpses of the
aboriginal inhabitants. The two navigators had different
fortunes. Tschirikoff, deprived of his boats, and
therefore unable to land, hurried home. Adverse winds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and storms interfered. He supplied himself with fresh
water by distilling sea-water or pressing rain-water from
the sails. But at last, on the 9th of October, he reached
Kamtchatka, with his ship’s company of seventy diminished
to forty-nine. During this time Behring was
driven, like Ulysses, on the uncertain waves. A single
tempest raged for seventeen days, so that Andrew Hasselberg,
the ancient pilot, who had known the sea for
fifty years, declared that he had seen nothing like it in
his life. Scurvy came with disheartening horrors. The
Commodore himself was a sufferer. Rigging broke;
cables snapped; anchors were lost. At last the tempest-tossed
vessel was cast upon a desert island, then without
a name, where the Commodore, sheltered in a ditch,
and half covered with sand as a protection against cold,
died, 8th December, 1741. His body, after his decease,
was “scraped out of the ground” and buried on this
island, which is called by his name, and constitutes
an outpost of the Asiatic continent. Thus the Russian
navigator, after the discovery of America, died in Asia.
Russia, by the recent demarcation, does not fail to retain
his last resting-place among her possessions.</p>

<h4>TITLE OF RUSSIA.</h4>

<p>For some time after these expeditions, by which
Russia achieved the palm of discovery, imperial enterprise
in those seas slumbered. The knowledge already
acquired was continued and confirmed only by
private individuals, who were led there in quest of
furs. In 1745 the Aleutian Islands were discovered
by an adventurer in search of sea-otters. In successive
voyages all these islands were visited for similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
purposes. Among these was Oonalaska, the principal
of the group of Fox Islands, constituting a continuation
of the Aleutian Islands, whose inhabitants and productions
were minutely described. In 1768 private enterprise
was superseded by an expedition ordered by the
Empress Catharine, which, leaving Kamtchatka, explored
this whole archipelago and the peninsula of
Alaska, which to the islanders stood for the whole continent.
Shortly afterwards, all these discoveries, beginning
with those of Behring and Tschirikoff, were
verified by the great English navigator, Captain Cook.
In 1778 he sailed along the northwestern coast, “near
where Tschirikoff anchored in 1741”; then again in
sight of mountains “wholly covered with snow from
the highest summit down to the sea-coast,” with “the
summit of an elevated mountain above the horizon,”
which he supposed to be the Mount St. Elias of Behring;
then by the very anchorage of Behring; then
among the islands through which Behring zigzagged,
and along the coast by the island of St. Lawrence, until
arrested by ice. If any doubt existed with regard
to Russian discoveries, it was removed by the authentic
report of this navigator, who shed such a flood of
light upon the geography of the whole region.</p>

<p>Such from the beginning is the title of Russia, dating
at least from 1741. I have not stopped to quote volume
and page, but I beg to be understood as following
approved authorities, and I refer especially to the
Russian work of Müller, already cited, on the “Voyages
from Asia to America,” the volume of Coxe on “Russian
Discoveries,” with its supplement on the “Comparative
View of the Russian Discoveries,” the volume of Sir
John Barrow on “Voyages into the Arctic Regions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>”
Burney’s “Northeastern Voyages,” and the third voyage
of Captain Cook, unhappily interrupted by his tragical
death from the natives of the Sandwich Islands,
but not until after the exploration of this coast.</p>

<p>There were at least four other Russian expeditions,
by which this title was confirmed, if it needed any
confirmation. The first was ordered by the Empress
Catharine, in 1785. It was under the command of
Commodore Billings, an Englishman in the service of
Russia, and was narrated from the original papers by
Martin Sauer, secretary of the expedition. In the instructions
from the Admiralty at St. Petersburg the
Commodore was directed to take possession of “such
coasts and islands as he shall first discover, whether
inhabited or not, that cannot be disputed, and are not
yet subject to any European power, with consent of
the inhabitants, if any”; and this was to be accomplished
by setting up “posts marked with the arms of
Russia, with letters indicating the time of discovery,
a short account of the people, their voluntary submission
to the Russian sovereignty, and that this was done
under the glorious reign of the great Catharine the Second.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The next was in 1803-6, in the interest of the
Russian American Company, with two ships, one under
the command of Captain Krusenstern, and the other of
Captain Lisiansky, of the Russian navy. It was the
first Russian voyage round the world, and lasted three
years. During its progress, Lisiansky visited the northwest
coast of America, and especially Sitka and the
island of Kadiak. Still another enterprise, organized
by the celebrated minister Count Romanzoff, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
his expense, left Russia in 1815, under the command
of Lieutenant Kotzebue, an officer of the Russian navy,
and son of the German dramatist, whose assassination
darkened the return of the son from his long voyage.
It is enough for the present to say of this expedition
that it has left its honorable traces on the coast even
as far as the Frozen Ocean. There remains the enterprise
of Lütke, at the time captain, and afterward admiral
in the Russian navy, which was a voyage of circumnavigation,
embracing especially the Russian possessions,
commenced in 1826, and described in French
with instructive fulness. With him sailed the German
naturalist Kittlitz, who has done so much to illustrate
the natural history of this region.</p>

<h4>A FRENCH ASPIRATION ON THIS COAST.</h4>

<p>So little was the Russian title recognized for some
time, that, when the unfortunate expedition of La Pérouse,
with the frigates Boussole and Astrolabe, stopped
on this coast in 1786, he did not hesitate to consider
the friendly harbor, in latitude 58° 36´, where he was
moored, as open to permanent occupation. Describing
this harbor, which he named Port des Français, as
sheltered behind a breakwater of rocks, with a calm
sea and a mouth sufficiently large, he announces that
Nature seemed to have created at the extremity of
America a port like that of Toulon, but vaster in plan
and accommodations; and then, considering that it
had never been discovered before, that it was situated
thirty-three leagues northwest of Los Remedios, the
limit of Spanish navigation, about two hundred and
twenty-four leagues from Nootka, and a hundred leagues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
from Prince William Sound, the mariner records his
judgment, that, “if the French Government had any
project of a factory on this part of the coast of America,
no nation could pretend to have the slightest right to
oppose it.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Thus quietly was Russia dislodged. The
frigates sailed further on their voyage, and never returned
to France. Their fate was unknown, until, after
fruitless search and the lapse of a generation, some relics
from them were accidentally found on an obscure
island of the Southern Pacific. The unfinished journal
of La Pérouse, recording his visit to this coast, had been
sent overland, by way of Kamtchatka and Siberia, to
France, where it was published by a decree of the National
Assembly, thus making known his supposed discovery
and his aspiration.</p>

<h4>EARLY SPANISH CLAIM.</h4>

<p>Spain also has been a claimant. In 1775, Bodega,
a Spanish navigator, seeking new opportunities to plant
the Spanish flag, reached the parallel of 58° on this
coast, not far from Sitka; but this supposed discovery
was not followed by any immediate assertion of dominion.
The universal aspiration of Spain had embraced
this whole region even at an early day, and
shortly after the return of Bodega another enterprise
was equipped to verify the larger claim, being nothing
less than the original title as discoverer of the strait
between America and Asia, and of the conterminous
continent, under the name of Anian. This curious episode
is not out of place in the present brief history.
It has two branches: one concerning early maps, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
which straits are represented between America and Asia
under the name of Anian; the other concerning a pretended
attempt by a Spanish navigator at an early day
to find these straits.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that early maps exist with
northwestern straits marked Anian. There are two in
the Congressional Library, in atlases of the years 1680
and 1717; but these are of a date comparatively modern.
Engel, in his “Mémoires Géographiques,” mentions
several earlier, which he believes genuine. There
is one purporting to be by Zaltieri, and bearing date
1566, an authentic pen-and-ink copy of which is now
before me, from the collection of our own Coast Survey.
On this very interesting map, which is without latitude
or longitude, the western coast of the continent is delineated
with a strait separating it from Asia not unlike
Behring’s in outline, and with the name in Italian,
<i>Stretto di Anian</i>. Southward the coast has a certain
conformity with what is now known to exist. Below
is an indentation corresponding to Bristol Bay; then a
peninsula somewhat broader than that of Alaska; then
the elbow of the coast; then, lower down, three islands,
not unlike Sitka, Queen Charlotte, and Vancouver; and
then, further south, is the peninsula of Lower California.
Sometimes the story of Anian is explained by the
voyage of the Portuguese navigator Gaspar de Cortereal,
in 1500, when, on reaching Hudson Bay in quest
of a passage round America, he imagined that he had
found it, and proceeded to name his discovery “in honor
of two brothers who accompanied him.” Very soon maps
began to record the Strait of Anian; but this does not
explain the substantial conformity of the early delineation
with the reality, which seems truly remarkable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>The other branch of inquiry is more easily disposed
of. This turns on a Spanish document entitled “A Relation
of the Discovery of the Strait of Anian, made
by me, Captain Lorenzo Ferrer Maldonado, in the Year
1588.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> If this early account of a northwest passage
from the Atlantic to the Pacific were authentic, the
whole question would be settled; but recent geographers
indignantly discard it as a barefaced imposture.
Clearly Spain once regarded it otherwise; for her Government
in 1789 sent out an expedition “to discover
the strait by which Laurent Ferrer Maldonado was supposed
to have passed, in 1588, from the coast of Labrador
to the Great Ocean.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The expedition was unsuccessful,
and nothing more has been heard of any claim
from this pretended discovery. The story of Maldonado
has taken its place in the same category with that of
Munchausen.</p>

<h4>REASONS FOR CESSION BY RUSSIA.</h4>

<p>Turning from the question of title, which time and
testimony have already settled, I meet the inquiry,
Why does Russia part with possessions associated with
the reign of her greatest ruler and filling an important
chapter of geographical history? Here I am without
information not open to others. But I do not forget
that the first Napoleon, in parting with Louisiana, was
controlled by three several considerations. First, he
needed the purchase-money for his treasury; secondly,
he was unwilling to leave this distant unguarded territory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
a prey to Great Britain, in the event of hostilities,
which seemed at hand; and, thirdly, he was glad, according
to his own remarkable language, “to establish
forever the power of the United States, and give to England
a maritime rival that would sooner or later humble
her pride.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Such is the record of history. Perhaps a
similar record may be made hereafter with regard to
the present cession. There is reason to imagine that
Russia, with all her great empire, is financially poor; so
that these few millions may not be unimportant to her.
It is by foreign loans that her railroads have been built
and her wars aided. All, too, must see that in those
“coming events” which now more than ever “cast their
shadows before” it will be for her advantage not to
hold outlying possessions from which thus far she has
obtained no income commensurate with the possible
expense for their protection. Perhaps, like a wrestler,
she strips for the contest, which I trust sincerely may
be averted. Besides, I cannot doubt that her enlightened
Emperor, who has given pledges to civilization
by an unsurpassed act of Emancipation, would join
the first Napoleon in a desire to enhance the maritime
power of the United States.</p>

<p>These general considerations are reinforced, when we
call to mind the little influence which Russia has been
able thus far to exercise in this region. Though possessing
dominion for more than a century, the gigantic
power has not been more genial or productive there
than the soil itself. Her government is little more
than a name or a shadow. It is not even a skeleton.
It is hardly visible. Its only representative is a fur
company, to which has been added latterly an ice company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
The immense country is without form and without
light, without activity and without progress. Distant
from the imperial capital, and separated from the
huge bulk of Russian empire, it does not share the vitality
of a common country. Its life is solitary and feeble.
Its settlements are only encampments or lodges. Its
fisheries are only a petty perquisite, belonging to local
or personal adventurers rather than to the commerce of
nations.</p>

<p>In these statements I follow the record. So little
were these possessions regarded during the last century
that they were scarcely recognized as a component
part of the empire. I have now before me an
authentic map, published by the Academy of Sciences
at St. Petersburg in 1776, and reproduced at London
in 1780, entitled “General Map of the Russian Empire,”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
where you will look in vain for Russian America,
unless we except the links of the Aleutian chain
nearest to the two continents. Alexander Humboldt,
whose geographical insight was unerring, in his great
work on New Spain, published in 1811, after stating
that he is able from an official document to give the
position of the Russian factories on the American continent,
says that they are “for the most part mere collections
of sheds and cabins, but serving as store-houses
for the fur-trade.” He remarks further that “the larger
part of these small Russian colonies communicate with
each other only by sea”; and then, putting us on our
guard not to expect too much from a name, he proceeds
to say that “the new denomination of ‘Russian America,’
or ‘Russian Possessions on the New Continent,’
must not lead us to think that the coasts of Behrin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>g’s
Basin, the peninsula of Alaska, or the country of the
Tchuktchi have become Russian provinces in the sense
given to this word in speaking of the Spanish provinces
of Sonora or New Biscay.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Here is a distinction between
the foothold of Spain in California and the foothold
of Russia in North America which will at least illustrate
the slender power of the latter in this region.</p>

<p>In ceding possessions so little within the sphere of
her empire, embracing more than one hundred nations
or tribes, Russia gives up no part of herself; and even
if she did, the considerable price paid, the alarm of
war which begins to fill our ears, and the sentiments
of friendship declared for the United States would explain
the transaction.</p>

<h4>THE NEGOTIATION, IN ITS ORIGIN AND COMPLETION.</h4>

<p>I am not able to say when the idea of this cession
first took shape. I have heard that it was as long ago
as the Administration of Mr. Polk. It is within my
knowledge that the Russian Government was sounded
on the subject during the Administration of Mr. Buchanan.
This was done through Mr. Gwin, at the time
Senator of California, and Mr. Appleton, Assistant Secretary
of State. For this purpose the former had more
than one interview with the Russian minister at Washington,
some time in December, 1859, in which, while
professing to speak for the President unofficially, he
represented that “Russia was too far off to make the
most of these possessions, and that, as we were near, we
could derive more from them.” In reply to an inquiry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
of the Russian minister, Mr. Gwin said that “the United
States could go as high as $5,000,000 for the purchase,”
on which the former made no comment. Mr. Appleton,
on another occasion, said to the minister that “the
President thought the acquisition would be very profitable
to the States on the Pacific; that he was ready to
follow it up, but wished to know in advance if Russia
was ready to cede; that, if she were, he would confer
with his Cabinet and influential members of Congress.”
All this was unofficial; but it was promptly communicated
to the Russian Government, who seem to have
taken it into careful consideration. Prince Gortchakoff,
in a despatch which reached here early in the
summer of 1860, said that “the offer was not what
might have been expected, but that it merited mature
reflection; that the Minister of Finance was about to
inquire into the condition of these possessions, after
which Russia would be in a condition to treat.” The
Prince added for himself, that “he was by no means
satisfied personally that it would be for the interest
of Russia politically to alienate these possessions; that
the only consideration which could make the scales incline
that way would be the prospect of great financial
advantages, but that the sum of $5,000,000 did not
seem in any way to represent the real value of these
possessions”; and he concluded by asking the minister
to tell Mr. Appleton and Senator Gwin that the sum
offered was not considered “an equitable equivalent.”
The subject was submerged by the Presidential election
which was approaching, and then by the Rebellion.
It will be observed that this attempt was at a
time when politicians who believed in the perpetuity
of Slavery still had power. Mr. Buchanan was President,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and he employed as his intermediary a known
sympathizer with Slavery, who shortly afterwards became
a Rebel. Had Russia been willing, it is doubtful
if this controlling interest would have sanctioned
any acquisition too far north for Slavery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Rebellion was brought to an end, and
peaceful enterprise was renewed, which on the Pacific
coast was directed toward the Russian possessions. Our
people there, wishing new facilities to obtain fish, fur,
and ice, sought the intervention of the National Government.
The Legislature of Washington Territory, in
the winter of 1866, adopted the following memorial to
the President of the United States, entitled “In reference
to the cod and other fisheries.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

“<i>President of the United States</i>.</p>

<p>“Your memorialists, the Legislative Assembly of Washington
Territory, beg leave to show that abundance of codfish,
halibut, and salmon, of excellent quality, have been found
along the shores of the Russian possessions. Your memorialists
respectfully request your Excellency to obtain such
rights and privileges of the Government of Russia as will
enable our fishing vessels to visit the ports and harbors of
its possessions, to the end that fuel, water, and provisions
may be easily obtained, that our sick and disabled fishermen
may obtain sanitary assistance, together with the privilege
of curing fish and repairing vessels in need of repairs.
Your memorialists further request that the Treasury Department
be instructed to forward to the collector of customs of
this Puget Sound district such fishing licenses, abstract journals,
and log-books as will enable our hardy fishermen to
obtain the bounties now provided and paid to the fishermen
in the Atlantic States. Your memorialists finally pray your
Excellency to employ such ships as may be spared from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>

bound, your memorialists will ever pray.</p>

“<i>President of the Council</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>This memorial, on presentation to the President, in
February, 1866, was referred to the Secretary of State,
by whom it was communicated to Mr. de Stoeckl, the
Russian minister, with remarks on the importance of
some early and comprehensive arrangement between the
two powers to prevent the growth of difficulties, especially
from the fisheries in that region. At the same
time reports began to prevail of extraordinary wealth
in fisheries, especially the whale and cod, promising to
become an important commerce on the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards another influence was felt. Mr.
Cole, who had been recently elected to the Senate from
California, acting in behalf of certain persons in that
State, sought from the Russian Government a license
or franchise to gather furs in a portion of its American
possessions. The charter of the Russian American
Company was about to expire. This company had
already underlet to the Hudson’s Bay Company all its
franchise on the main-land between 54° 40´ and Cape
Spencer; and now it was proposed that an American
company, holding directly from the Russian Government,
should be substituted for the latter. The mighty
Hudson’s Bay Company, with headquarters in London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
was to give way to an American company, with headquarters
in California. Among letters on this subject
addressed to Mr. Cole, and now before me, is one dated
San Francisco, April 10, 1866, in which the scheme is
developed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is at the present time a good chance to organize
a fur-trading company, to trade between the United States
and the Russian possessions in America; and as the charter
formerly granted to the Hudson’s Bay Company has expired,
this would be the opportune moment to start in.…
I should think that by a little management this charter
could be obtained from the Russian Government for ourselves,
as I do not think they are very willing to renew the
charter of the Hudson’s Bay Company, and I think they
would give the preference to an American company, especially
if the company should pay to the Russian Government
five per cent. on the gross proceeds of their transactions,
and also aid in civilizing and ameliorating the condition
of the Indians by employing missionaries, if required
by the Russian Government. For the faithful performance
of the above we ask a charter for the term of twenty-five
years, to be renewed for the same length of time, if the
Russian Government finds the company deserving,&mdash;the
charter to invest us with the right of trading in all the
country between the British American line and the Russian
Archipelago.… Remember, we wish for the same charter
as was formerly granted to the Hudson’s Bay Company, and
we offer in return more than they did.”</p>

</div>

<p>Another correspondent of Mr. Cole, under date of
San Francisco, September 17, 1866, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have talked with a man who has been on the coast
and in the trade for ten years past, and he says it is much
more valuable than I have supposed, and I think it very
important to obtain it, if possible.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>The Russian minister at Washington, whom Mr. Cole
saw repeatedly upon the subject, was not authorized to
act, and the latter, after conference with the Department
of State, was induced to address Mr. Clay, minister
of the United States at St. Petersburg, who laid
the application before the Russian Government. This
was an important step. A letter from Mr. Clay, dated
at St. Petersburg as late as February 1, 1867, makes
the following revelation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Russian Government has already ceded away its
rights in Russian America for a term of years, and the
Russo-American Company has also ceded the same to the
Hudson’s Bay Company. This lease expires in June next,
and the president of the Russo-American Company tells me
that they have been in correspondence with the Hudson’s
Bay Company about a renewal of the lease for another term
of twenty-five or thirty years. Until he receives a definite
answer, he cannot enter into negotiations with us or your
California company. My opinion is, that, if he can get off
with the Hudson’s Bay Company, he will do so, when we
can make some arrangements with the Russo-American Company.”</p>

</div>

<p>Some time had elapsed since the original attempt of
Mr. Gwin, also a Senator from California, and it is
probable that the Russian Government had obtained information
which enabled it to see its way more clearly.
It will be remembered that Prince Gortchakoff had
promised an inquiry, and it is known that in 1861
Captain-Lieutenant Golowin, of the Russian navy, made
a detailed report on these possessions. Mr. Cole had
the advantage of his predecessor. There is reason to
believe, also, that the administration of the fur company
had not been entirely satisfactory, so that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
were well-founded hesitations with regard to the renewal
of its franchise. Meanwhile, in October, 1866,
Mr. de Stoeckl, who had long been the Russian minister
at Washington, and enjoyed in a high degree the
confidence of our Government, returned home on leave
of absence, promising his best exertions to promote good
relations between the two countries. While he was at
St. Petersburg, the applications from the United States
were under consideration; but the Russian Government
was disinclined to any minor arrangement of the character
proposed. Obviously something like a crisis was
at hand with regard to these possessions. The existing
government was not adequate. The franchises granted
there were about to terminate. Something must be
done. As Mr. de Stoeckl was leaving for his post, in
February, the Archduke Constantine, brother and chief
adviser of the Emperor, handed him a map with the
lines in our treaty marked upon it, and told him he
might treat for cession with those boundaries. The
minister arrived in Washington early in March. A negotiation
was opened at once. Final instructions were
received by the Atlantic cable, from St. Petersburg, on
the 29th of March, and at four o’clock on the morning
of the 30th of March this important treaty was signed
by Mr. Seward on the part of the United States and
by Mr. de Stoeckl on the part of Russia.</p>

<p>Few treaties have been conceived, initiated, prosecuted,
and completed in so simple a manner, without protocol
or despatch. The whole negotiation is seen in its
result, unless we except two brief notes, which constitute
all that passed between the negotiators. These
have an interest general and special, and I conclude
the history of this transaction by reading them.</p>

</div>

<h4>THE TREATY.</h4>

<p>The treaty begins with the declaration, that “the
United States of America and his Majesty the Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of all the Russias, being desirous of strengthening,
if possible, the good understanding which exists
between them,” have appointed plenipotentiaries, who
have proceeded to sign articles, wherein it is stipulated
on behalf of Russia that “his Majesty the Emperor of
all the Russias agrees to cede to the United States
by this convention, immediately upon the exchange of
the ratifications thereof, all the territory and dominion
now possessed by his said Majesty on the continent of
America and in the adjacent islands, the same being
contained within the geographical limits herein set
forth”; and it is stipulated on behalf of the United
States, that, “in consideration of the cession aforesaid,
the United States agree to pay at the Treasury in
Washington, within ten months after the exchange of
the ratifications of this convention, to the diplomatic
representative or other agent of his Majesty the Emperor
of all the Russias duly authorized to receive the
same, $7,200,000 in gold.” The ratifications are to be
exchanged within three months from the date of the
treaty, or sooner, if possible.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Beyond the consideration founded on the desire of
“strengthening the good understanding” between the
two countries, there is the pecuniary consideration already
mentioned, which underwent a change in the
progress of the negotiation. The sum of seven millions
was originally agreed upon; but when it appeared
that there was a fur company and also an ice company
enjoying monopolies under the existing government, it
was thought best that these should be extinguished, in
consideration of which our Government added two hundred
thousand to the purchase-money, and the Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Government in formal terms declared “the cession of
territory and dominion to be free and unincumbered
by any reservations, privileges, franchises, grants, or
possessions, by any associated companies, whether corporate
or incorporate, Russian or any other, or by any
parties, except merely private individual property-holders.”
Thus the United States receive the cession free
of all incumbrances, so far at least as Russia is in a
condition to make it. The treaty proceeds to say: “The
cession hereby made conveys all the rights, franchises,
and privileges now belonging to Russia in the said territory
or dominion and appurtenances thereto.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In
other words, Russia conveys all she has to convey.</p>

<h4>QUESTIONS ARISING UNDER THE TREATY.</h4>

<p>There are questions, not unworthy of attention, which
arise under the treaty between Russia and Great Britain,
fixing the eastern limits of these possessions, and conceding
certain privileges to the latter power. By this
treaty, signed at St. Petersburg, 28th February, 1825,
after fixing the boundaries between the Russian and
British possessions, it is provided that “for the space
of <em>ten years</em> from the signature of the present convention,
the vessels of the two powers, or those belonging
to their respective subjects, shall mutually be at liberty
to frequent, without any hindrance whatever, all the
inland seas, the gulfs, havens, and creeks on the coast,
for the purposes of fishing and of trading with the
natives”; and also that “the port of Sitka, or Novo
Archangelsk, shall be open to the commerce and vessels
of British subjects for the space of <em>ten years</em> from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the date of the exchange of the ratifications of the present
convention.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In the same treaty it is also provided
that “the subjects of his Britannic Majesty, from whatever
quarter they may arrive, whether from the ocean
or from the interior of the continent, shall <em>forever</em> enjoy
the right of navigating freely and without any hindrance
whatever all the rivers and streams which in
their course towards the Pacific Ocean may cross the
line of demarcation.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Afterwards a treaty of commerce
and navigation between Russia and Great Britain
was signed at St. Petersburg, 11th January, 1843, subject
to be terminated on notice from either party at
the expiration of ten years, in which it is provided,
that, “in regard to commerce and navigation in the
Russian possessions on the northwest coast of America,
the convention concluded at St. Petersburg on the
16/28th February, 1825, continues in force.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Then ensued
the Crimean War between Russia and Great Britain,
effacing or suspending treaties. Afterwards another
treaty of commerce and navigation was signed at
St. Petersburg, 12th January, 1859, subject to be terminated
on notice from either party at the expiration
of ten years, which repeats the last provision.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Thus we have three different stipulations on the part
of Russia: one opening seas, gulfs, and havens on the
Russian coast to British subjects for fishing and trading
with the natives; the second making Sitka a free
port to British subjects; and the third making British
rivers which flow through the Russian possessions
forever free to British navigation. Do the United States
succeed to these stipulations?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Among these I make a distinction in favor of the
last, which by its language is declared to be “forever,”
and may have been in the nature of an equivalent at
the settlement of boundaries between the two powers.
But whatever its terms or its origin, it is obvious that
it is nothing but a declaration of public law, as always
expounded by the United States, and now recognized
on the continent of Europe. While pleading with Great
Britain, in 1826, for the free navigation of the St. Lawrence,
Mr. Clay, then Secretary of State, said that “the
American Government did not mean to contend for
any principle the benefit of which in analogous circumstances
it would deny to Great Britain.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> During
the same year, Mr. Gallatin, our minister in London,
when negotiating with Great Britain for the adjustment
of boundaries on the Pacific, proposed, that, “if
the line should cross any of the branches of the Columbia
at points from which they are navigable by boats
to the main stream, the navigation of such branches
and of the main stream should be perpetually free and
common to the people of both nations.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> At an earlier
day the United States made the same claim with regard
to the Mississippi, and asserted, as a general principle,
that, “if the right of the upper inhabitants to descend
the stream was in any case obstructed, it was an act of
force by a stronger society against a weaker, condemned
by the judgment of mankind.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> By these admissions
our country is estopped, even if the public law of the
European continent, first declared at Vienna with regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
to the Rhine, did not offer an example which we cannot
afford to reject. I rejoice to believe that on this occasion
we apply to Great Britain the generous rule which
from the beginning we have claimed for ourselves.</p>

<p>The two other stipulations are different in character.
They are not declared to be “forever,” and do not stand
on any principle of public law. Even if subsisting now,
they cannot be onerous. I doubt much if they are subsisting
now. In succeeding to the Russian possessions,
it does not follow that the United States succeed to
ancient obligations assumed by Russia, as if, according
to a phrase of the Common Law, they were “covenants
running with the land.” If these stipulations are in
the nature of <em>servitudes</em>, they depend for their duration
on the sovereignty of Russia, and are <em>personal</em> or <em>national</em>
rather than <em>territorial</em>. So, at least, I am inclined
to believe. But it is hardly profitable to speculate
on a point of so little practical value. Even if
“running with the land,” these servitudes can be terminated
at the expiration of ten years from the last treaty
by notice, which equitably the United States may give,
so as to take effect on the 12th of January, 1869. Meanwhile,
during this brief period, it will be easy by Act
of Congress in advance to limit importations at Sitka,
so that this “free port” shall not be made the channel
or doorway by which British goods are introduced into
the United States free of duty.</p>

<h4>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON THE TREATY.</h4>

<p>From this survey of the treaty, as seen in its origin
and the questions under it, I might pass at once to a
survey of the possessions which have been conveyed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
but there are other matters of a more general character
which present themselves at this stage and challenge
judgment. These concern nothing less than the unity,
power, and grandeur of the Republic, with the extension
of its dominion and its institutions. Such considerations,
where not entirely inapplicable, are apt to
be controlling. I do not doubt that they will in a
great measure determine the fate of this treaty with
the American people. They are patent, and do not
depend on research or statistics. To state them is
enough.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. <i>Advantages to the Pacific Coast.</i>&mdash;Foremost in
order, if not in importance, I put the desires of our
fellow-citizens on the Pacific coast, and the special advantages
they will derive from this enlargement of
boundary. They were the first to ask for it, and will
be the first to profit by it. While others knew the
Russian possessions only on the map, they knew them
practically in their resources. While others were indifferent,
they were planning how to appropriate Russian
peltries and fisheries. This is attested by the resolutions
of the Legislature of Washington Territory; also
by the exertions at different times of two Senators from
California, who, differing in political sentiments and in
party relations, took the initial steps which ended in
this treaty.</p>

<p>These well-known desires were founded, of course, on
supposed advantages; and here experience and neighborhood
were prompters. Since 1854 the people of
California have received their ice from the fresh-water
lakes in the island of Kadiak, not far westward from
Mount St. Elias. Later still, their fishermen have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
searched the waters about the Aleutians and the Shumagins,
commencing a promising fishery. Others have
proposed to substitute themselves for the Hudson’s Bay
Company in their franchise on the coast. But all are
looking to the Orient, as in the time of Columbus, although
like him they sail to the west. To them China
and Japan, those ancient realms of fabulous wealth, are
the Indies. To draw this commerce to the Pacific coast
is no new idea. It haunted the early navigators. Meares,
the Englishman, whose voyage in the intervening seas
was in 1788, recounts a meeting with Gray, the Boston
navigator, whom he found “very sanguine in the superior
advantages which his countrymen from New England
might reap from this track of trade, and big with
many mighty projects.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> He closes his volumes with
an essay entitled “Some Account of the Trade between
the Northwest Coast of America and China, &amp;c.,” in
the course of which<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> he dwells on the “great and
very valuable source of commerce” offered by China
as “forming a chain of trade between Hudson’s Bay,
Canada, and the Northwest Coast”; and then he exhibits
on the American side the costly furs of the sea-otter,
still so much prized in China,&mdash;“mines which are
known to lie between the latitudes of 40° and 60° north,”&mdash;and
also ginseng “in inexhaustible plenty,” for which
there is still such demand in China, that even Minnesota,
at the head-waters of the Mississippi, supplies her
contribution. His catalogue might be extended now.</p>

<p>As a practical illustration of this idea, it may be
mentioned, that, for a long time, most, if not all, the
sea-otter skins of this coast found their way to China.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
China was the best customer, and therefore Englishmen
and Americans followed the Russian Company in carrying
these furs to her market, so that Pennant, the
English naturalist, impressed by the peculiar advantages
of the coast, exclaimed, “What a profitable trade [with
China] might not a colony carry on, was it possible to
penetrate to these parts of North America by means of
the rivers and lakes!”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Under the present treaty this
coast is ours.</p>

<p>The absence of harbors belonging to the United States
on the Pacific limits the outlets of the country. On that
whole extent, from Panama to Puget Sound, the only
harbor of any considerable value is San Francisco. Further
north the harbors are abundant, and they are all
nearer to the great marts of Japan and China. But
San Francisco itself will be nearer by the way of the
Aleutians than by Honolulu. The projection of maps
is not always calculated to present an accurate idea of
distances. From measurement on a globe it appears
that a voyage from San Francisco to Hong Kong by the
common way of the Sandwich Islands is 7,140 miles, but
by way of the Aleutian Islands it is only 6,060 miles,
being a saving of more than one thousand miles, with
the enormous additional advantage of being obliged to
carry much less coal. Of course a voyage from Sitka, or
from Puget Sound, the terminus of the Northern Pacific
Railroad, would be shorter still.</p>

<p>The advantages to the Pacific coast have two aspects,&mdash;one
domestic, and the other foreign. Not only does
the treaty extend the coasting trade of California, Oregon,
and Washington Territory northward, but it also
extends the base of commerce with China and Japan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>To unite the East of Asia with the West of America
is the aspiration of commerce now as when the English
navigator recorded his voyage. Of course, whatever
helps this result is an advantage. The Pacific
Railroad is such an advantage; for, though running
westward, it will be, when completed, a new highway
to the East. This treaty is another advantage; for
nothing can be clearer than that the western coast
must exercise an attraction which will be felt in China
and Japan just in proportion as it is occupied by a
commercial people communicating readily with the Atlantic
and with Europe. This cannot be without consequences
not less important politically than commercially.
Owing so much to the Union, the people there
will be bound to it anew, and the national unity will
receive another confirmation. Thus the whole country
will be a gainer. So are we knit together that the
advantages to the Pacific coast will contribute to the
general welfare.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>2. <i>Extension of Dominion.</i>&mdash;The extension of dominion
is another consideration calculated to captivate
the public mind. Few are so cold or philosophical as
to regard with insensibility a widening of the bounds
of country. Wars have been regarded as successful,
when they have given a new territory. The discoverer
who had planted the flag of his sovereign on a
distant coast has been received as a conqueror. The
ingratitude exhibited to Columbus during his later days
was compensated by the epitaph, that he had “found a
new world for Castile and Leon.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> His discoveries were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
continued by other navigators, and Spain girdled the
earth with her possessions. Portugal, France, Holland,
England, each followed the example of Spain, and rejoiced
in extended empire.</p>

<p>Territorial acquisitions are among the landmarks of
our history. In 1803, Louisiana, embracing the valley
of the Mississippi, was acquired from France for fifteen
million dollars. In 1819, Florida was acquired from
Spain for about three million dollars. In 1845, Texas
was annexed without purchase, but subsequently, under
the compromises of 1850, an allowance of twelve and
three fourth million dollars was made to her. In 1848,
California, New Mexico, and Utah were acquired from
Mexico after war, and on payment of fifteen million
dollars. In 1854, Arizona was acquired from Mexico
for ten million dollars. And now it is proposed to acquire
Russian America.</p>

<p>The passion for acquisition, so strong in the individual,
is not less strong in the community. A nation
seeks an outlying territory, as an individual seeks
an outlying farm. The passion shows itself constantly.
France, passing into Africa, has annexed Algeria. Spain
set her face in the same direction, but without the same
success. There are two great powers with which annexion
has become a habit. One is Russia, which from
the time of Peter has been moving her flag forward in
every direction, so that on every side her limits have
been extended. Even now the report comes that she
is lifting her southern landmarks in Asia, so as to carry
her boundary to India. The other annexionist is Great
Britain, which from time to time adds another province to
her Indian empire. If the United States have from
time to time added to their dominion, they have only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
yielded to the universal passion, although I do not forget
that the late Theodore Parker was accustomed to
speak of Anglo-Saxons as among all people remarkable
for “greed of land.” It was land, not gold, that
aroused the Anglo-Saxon phlegm. I doubt, however, if
this passion be stronger with us than with others, except,
perhaps, that in a community where all participate
in government the national sentiments are more
active. It is common to the human family. There are
few anywhere who could hear of a considerable accession
of territory, obtained peacefully and honestly, without
a pride of country, even if at certain moments the
judgment hesitated. With increased size on the map
there is increased consciousness of strength, and the
heart of the citizen throbs anew as he traces the extending
line.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>3. <i>Extension of Republican Institutions.</i>&mdash;More than
the extension of dominion is the extension of republican
institutions, which is a traditional aspiration. It was
in this spirit that Independence was achieved. In the
name of Human Rights our fathers overthrew the kingly
power, whose representative was George the Third.
They set themselves openly against this form of government.
They were against it for themselves, and offered
their example to mankind. They were Roman in character,
and turned to Roman lessons. With cynical austerity
the early Cato said that kings were “carnivorous
animals,” and probably at his instance it was decreed
by the Roman Senate that no king should be allowed
within the gates of the city. A kindred sentiment,
with less austerity of form, has been received from our
fathers; but our city can be nothing less than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
North American continent, with its gates on all the
surrounding seas.</p>

<p>John Adams, in the preface to his Defence of the
American Constitutions, written in London, where he
resided at the time as minister, and dated January 1,
1787, at Grosvenor Square, the central seat of aristocratic
fashion, after exposing the fabulous origin of
the kingly power in contrast with the simple origin
of our republican constitutions, thus for a moment lifts
the curtain: “Thirteen governments,” he says plainly,
“thus founded on the natural authority of the people
alone, without a pretence of miracle or mystery, and
<em>which are destined to spread over the northern part of
that whole quarter of the globe</em>, are a great point gained
in favor of the rights of mankind.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Thus, according
to the prophetic minister, even at that early day was
the destiny of the Republic manifest. It was to spread
over the northern part of the American quarter of the
globe, and it was to help the rights of mankind.</p>

<p>By the text of our Constitution, the United States
are bound to guaranty “a republican form of government”
to every State in the Union; but this obligation,
which is applicable only at home, is an unquestionable
indication of the national aspiration everywhere.
The Republic is something more than a local
policy; it is a general principle, not to be forgotten
at any time, especially when the opportunity is presented
of bringing an immense region within its influence.
Elsewhere it has for the present failed; but
on this account our example is more important. Who
can forget the generous lament of Lord Byron, whose
passion for Freedom was not mitigated by his rank as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
an hereditary legislator of England, when he exclaims,
in memorable verse,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The name of Commonwealth is past and gone</div>
<div class="verse">O’er the three fractions of the groaning globe”?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Who can forget the salutation which the poet sends to
the “one great clime,” which, nursed in Freedom, enjoys
what he calls the “proud distinction” of not being
confounded with other lands,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Whose sons must bow them at a monarch’s motion,</div>
<div class="verse">As if his senseless sceptre were a wand”?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The present treaty is a visible step in the occupation
of the whole North American continent. As such
it will be recognized by the world and accepted by the
American people. But the treaty involves something
more. We dismiss one other monarch from the continent.
One by one they have retired,&mdash;first France,
then Spain, then France again, and now Russia,&mdash;all
giving way to the absorbing Unity declared in the national
motto, <i>E pluribus unum</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>4. <i>Anticipation of Great Britain.</i>&mdash;Another motive
to this acquisition may be found in the desire to
anticipate imagined schemes or necessities of Great
Britain. With regard to all these I confess doubt;
and yet, if we credit report, it would seem as if there
were already a British movement in this direction.
Sometimes it is said that Great Britain desires to buy,
if Russia will sell. Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-chief
of the Hudson’s Bay Company, declared, that,
without the strip on the coast underlet to them by
the Russian Company, the interior would be “comparatively
useless to England.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Here, then, is provocation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
to buy. Sometimes report assumes a graver character.
A German scientific journal, in an elaborate
paper entitled “The Russian Colonies on the Northwest
Coast of America,” after referring to the constant
“pressure” upon Russia, proceeds to say that there are
already crowds of adventurers from British Columbia
and California now at the gold mines on the Stikine,
which flows from British territory through the Russian
possessions, who openly declare their purpose of driving
the Russians out of this region. I refer to the “Archiv
für Wissenschaftliche Kunde von Russland,”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> edited at
Berlin as late as 1863, by A. Erman, and undoubtedly
the leading authority on Russian questions. At the
same time it presents a curious passage bearing directly
on British policy, purporting to be taken from the
“British Colonist,” a newspaper of Victoria, on Vancouver’s
Island. As this was regarded of sufficient
importance to be translated into German for the instruction
of scientific readers, I am justified in laying
it before you, restored from German to English.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The information which we daily publish from the Stikine
River very naturally excites public attention in a high degree.
Whether the territory through which the river flows
be regarded from a political, commercial, or industrial point
of view, it promises within a short time to awaken a still
more general interest. Not only will the intervention of
the royal jurisdiction be demanded in order to give it a complete
form of government, but, if the land proves as rich as
there is now reason to believe it to be, it is not improbable
that it will result in negotiations between England and Russia
for the cession of the sea-coast to the British Crown. It
is not to be supposed that a stream like the Stikine, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
is navigable for steamers from one hundred and seventy to
one hundred and ninety miles, which waters a territory so
rich in gold that it will attract myriads of men,&mdash;that the
commerce upon such a road can always pass through a Russian
gateway of thirty miles from the sea-coast to the interior.
The English population which occupies the interior cannot
be so easily managed by the Russians as the Stikine Indians
of the coast manage the Indians of the interior. Our business
must be in British hands. Our resources, our energies,
our spirit of enterprise cannot be employed in building up a
Russian emporium at the mouth of the Stikine. We must
have for our merchandise a depot over which the British flag
waves. By the treaty of 1825 the navigation of the river
is secured to us. The navigation of the Mississippi was also
open to the United States before the Louisiana purchase;
but the growing strength of the North made the acquisition
of that territory, either by purchase or by force of arms, an
inevitable necessity. We look upon the sea-coast of the Stikine
region in the same light. The strip of land which
stretches along from Portland Canal to Mount St. Elias,
with a breadth of thirty miles, and which, according to the
treaty of 1825, forms a part of Russian America, <em>must eventually
become the property of Great Britain</em>, either as the direct
result of the gold discoveries, or from causes as yet not
fully developed, but whose operation is certain. For can we
reasonably suppose that the strip, three hundred miles long
and thirty miles wide, which is used by the Russians solely
for the collection of furs and walrus-teeth, will forever
control the entrance to our immense northern territory? It
is a principle of England to acquire territory only for purposes
of defence. Canada, Nova Scotia, Malta, the Cape of
Good Hope, and the greater part of our Indian possessions
were all acquired for purposes of defence. In Africa, India,
and China the same rule is followed by the Government to-day.
With a power like Russia it would perhaps be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
difficult to arrange matters; but if we need the sea-coast in
order to protect and maintain our commerce with an interior
rich in precious metals, then we must have it. The United
States needed Florida and Louisiana, and took them. We
need the coast of New Norfolk and New Cornwall.</p>

<p>“It is just as much the destiny of our Anglo-Norman
race to possess the whole of Russian America, however desolate
and inhospitable it may be, as it has been that of the
Russian Northmen to possess themselves of Northern Europe
and Asia. As the Wandering Jew and his phantom, so will
the Anglo-Norman and the Russian yet gaze at each other
from the opposite sides of Behring Strait. Between the two
races the northern halves of the Old and New World must
be divided. America must be ours.</p>

<p>“The recent discovery of the precious metals in our hyperborean
Eldorado will most probably hasten the annexation
of the territory in question. It can hardly be doubted that
the gold region of the Stikine extends away to the western
affluents of the Mackenzie. In this case the increase of the
business and of the population will exceed our most sanguine
expectations. Who shall reap the profit of this? The
mouths of rivers, both before and since the time of railroads,
have controlled the business of the interior. To our
national pride the thought, however, is intolerable, that the
Russian griffin should possess a point which is indebted to
the British lion for its importance. The mouth of the Stikine
must be ours,&mdash;or at least a harbor of export must be
established on British soil from which our steamers can pass
the Russian belt. Fort Simpson, Dundas Island, Portland
Canal, or some other convenient point, might be selected for
this purpose. The necessity of speedy measures, in order
to secure the control of the Stikine, is manifest. If we let
slip the opportunity, we shall live to see a Russian city arise
at the gates of a British colony.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thus, if we credit this colonial ejaculation, caught up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and preserved by German science, the Russian possessions
were destined to round and complete the domain
of Great Britain on this continent. The Russian “griffin”
was to give way to the British “lion.” The Anglo-Norman
was to be master as far as Behring Strait, across
which he might survey his Russian neighbor. How this
was to be accomplished is not precisely explained. The
promises of gold on the Stikine failed, and it is not improbable
that this colonial plan was as unsubstantial.
Colonists become excited easily. This is not the first
time that Russian America has been menaced in a similar
way. During the Crimean War there seemed to be
in Canada a spirit not unlike that of the Vancouver
journalist, unless we are misled by the able pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
of Mr. A. K. Roche, of Quebec, where, after describing
Russian America as “richer in resources and capabilities
than it has hitherto been allowed to be, either by the
English, who shamefully gave it up, or by the Russians,
who cunningly obtained it,” the author urges an expedition
for its conquest and annexion. His proposition fell
on the happy termination of the war, but it exists as
a warning, with notice also of a former English title,
“shamefully” abandoned.</p>

<p>This region is distant enough from Great Britain; but
there is an incident of past history which shows that
distance from the metropolitan government has not excluded
the idea of war. Great Britain could hardly be
more jealous of Russia on these coasts than was Spain
in a former day, if we listen to the report of Humboldt.
I refer again to his authoritative work, “Essai Politique
sur la Nouvelle-Espagne,”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> where it is recorded, that, as
early as 1788, even while peace was still unbroken, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Spaniards could not bear the idea of Russians in this
region, and when, in 1799, the Emperor Paul declared
war on Spain, the hardy project was formed of an expedition
from the Mexican ports of Monterey and San Blas
against the Russian colonies; on which the philosophic
traveller remarks, in words which are recalled by the
Vancouver manifesto, that, “if this project had been
executed, the world would have witnessed two nations
in conflict, which, occupying the opposite extremities of
Europe, found themselves neighbors in the other hemisphere
on the eastern and western boundaries of their
vast empires.” Thus, notwithstanding an intervening
circuit of half the globe, two great powers were about
to encounter each other on these coasts. But I hesitate
to believe that the British of our day, in any considerable
numbers, have adopted the early Spanish disquietude
at the presence of Russia on this continent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>5. <i>Amity of Russia.</i>&mdash;There is still another consideration
concerning this treaty not to be disregarded. It
attests and assures the amity of Russia. Even if you
doubt the value of these possessions, the treaty is a sign
of friendship. It is a new expression of that <i>entente
cordiale</i> between the two powers which is a phenomenon
of history. Though unlike in institutions, they are
not unlike in recent experience. Sharers of common
glory in a great act of Emancipation, they also share
together the opposition or antipathy of other nations.
Perhaps this experience has not been without effect in
bringing them together. At all events, no coldness or
unkindness has interfered at any time with their good
relations.</p>

<p>The archives of the State Department show an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
uninterrupted cordiality between the two Governments,
dating far back in our history. More than once Russia
has proffered her good offices between the United
States and Great Britain; once also she was a recognized
arbitrator. She offered her mediation to terminate
the War of 1812; and under her arbitration questions
with Great Britain arising under the Treaty of
Ghent were amicably settled in 1822. But it was during
our recent troubles that we felt more than ever her
friendly sentiments, although it is not improbable that
the accident of position and of distance had influence
in preserving these undisturbed. The Rebellion, which
tempted so many other powers into its embrace, could
not draw Russia from her habitual good-will. Her solicitude
for the Union was early declared. She made
no unjustifiable concession of <em>ocean belligerence</em>, with all
its immunities and powers, to Rebels in arms against
the Union. She furnished no hospitality to Rebel cruisers,
nor was any Rebel agent ever received, entertained,
or encouraged at St. Petersburg,&mdash;while, on the other
hand, there was an understanding that the United
States should be at liberty to carry prizes into Russian
ports. So natural and easy were the relations between
the two Governments, that such complaints as incidentally
arose on either side were amicably adjusted by
verbal explanations without written controversy.</p>

<p>Positive acts occurred to strengthen these relations.
As early as 1861, the two Governments agreed to act
together for the establishment of a connection between
San Francisco and St. Petersburg by an inter-oceanic
telegraph across Behring Strait; and this agreement
was subsequently sanctioned by Congress.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
occurred the visit of the Russian fleet in the winter
of 1863, intended by the Emperor, and accepted by the
United States, as a friendly demonstration. This was
followed by a communication of the Secretary of State,
dated 26th December, 1864, inviting the Archduke
Constantine to visit the United States, where it was
suggested that such a visit “would be beneficial to us
and by no means unprofitable to Russia,” but “forbearing
to specify reasons,” and assuring him, that, coming
as a national guest, he “would receive a cordial and
most demonstrative welcome.”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Affairs in Russia prevented
the acceptance of this invitation. Afterwards,
in the spring of 1866, Congress by solemn resolution
declared the sympathies of the United States with the
Emperor on his escape from the madness of an assassin,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
and Mr. Fox, at the time Assistant Secretary of the
Navy, was appointed to take the resolution of Congress
to the Emperor, and, in discharge of this trust, to declare
the friendly sentiments of our country for Russia.
He was conveyed to Cronstadt in the monitor Miantonomoh,
the most formidable ship of our navy, and thus
this agent of war became a messenger of peace. The
monitor and the minister were received in Russia with
unbounded hospitality.</p>

<p>In relations such as I have described, the cession of
territory seems a natural transaction, entirely in harmony
with the past. It remains to hope that it may
be a new link in an amity which, without effort, has
overcome differences of institutions and intervening
space on the globe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<h4>SHALL THE TREATY BE RATIFIED?</h4>

<p>Such are obvious considerations of a general character.
The interests of the Pacific States, the extension
of the national domain, the extension of republican
institutions, the foreclosure of adverse British possession,
and the amity of Russia,&mdash;these are the points
we have passed in review. Most of these, if not all,
are calculated to impress the public mind; but I can
readily understand a difference of opinion with regard
to the urgency of negotiation at this hour. Some may
think that the purchase-money and the annual outlay
that must follow might have been postponed another
decade, while Russia continued in possession as trustee
for our benefit; and yet some of the reasons for
the treaty do not seem to allow delay.</p>

<p>At all events, now that the treaty has been signed
by plenipotentiaries on each side duly empowered, it
is difficult to see how we can refuse to complete the
purchase without putting to hazard the friendly relations
which happily subsist between the United States
and Russia. The overtures originally proceeded from
us. After a delay of years, and other intervening propositions,
the bargain was at length concluded. It is
with nations as with individuals. A bargain once made
must be kept. Even if still open to consideration, it
must not be lightly abandoned. I am satisfied that the
dishonoring of this treaty, after what has passed, would
be a serious responsibility for our country. As an international
question, it would be tried by the public
opinion of the world; and there are many who, not
appreciating the requirement of our Constitution by
which a treaty must have “the advice and consent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the Senate,” would regard its rejection as bad faith.
There would be jeers at us, and jeers at Russia also:
at us for levity in making overtures, and at Russia for
levity in yielding to them. Had the Senate been consulted
in advance, before the treaty was signed or either
power publicly committed, as is often done on important
occasions, it would be under less constraint. On
such a consultation there would have been opportunity
for all possible objections, and a large latitude for reasonable
discretion. Let me add, that, while forbearing
objection now, I hope that this treaty may not be
drawn into a precedent, at least in the independent
manner of its negotiation. I would save to the Senate
an important power justly belonging to it.</p>

<h4>A CAVEAT.</h4>

<p>There is one other point on which I file my <i>caveat</i>.
This treaty must not be a precedent for a system of
indiscriminate and costly annexion. Sincerely believing
that republican institutions under the primacy of the
United States must embrace this whole continent, I
cannot adopt the sentiment of Jefferson, who, while
confessing satisfaction in settlements on the Pacific
coast, saw there in the future nothing but “free and
independent Americans,” bound to the United States
only by “ties of blood and interest,” without political
unity,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>&mdash;or of Webster, who in the same spirit said
of settlers there, “They will raise a standard for themselves,
and they ought to do it.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Nor am I willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
to restrict myself to the principle so tersely expressed
by Andrew Jackson, in his letter to President Monroe:
“Concentrate our population, confine our frontier
to proper limits, until our country, to those limits, is
filled with a dense population.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> But I cannot disguise
my anxiety that every stage in our predestined
future shall be by natural processes, without war, and
I would add even without purchase. There is no territorial
aggrandizement worth the price of blood. Only
under peculiar circumstances can it become the subject
of pecuniary contract. Our triumph should be by
growth and organic expansion in obedience to “preëstablished
harmony,” recognizing always the will of
those who are to become our fellow-citizens. All this
must be easy, if we are only true to ourselves. Our
motto may be that of Goethe: “Without haste, without
rest.” Let the Republic be assured in tranquil liberty,
with all equal before the law, and it will conquer
by its sublime example. More happy than Austria,
who acquired possessions by marriage, we shall acquire
them by the attraction of republican institutions.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The famous epigram will be just as applicable to us,
inasmuch as our acquisitions will be under the sanction
of wedlock to the Republic. There may be wedlock
of a people as well as of a prince. Meanwhile
our first care should be to improve and elevate the
Republic, whose sway will be so comprehensive. Plant
it with schools; cover it with churches; fill it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
libraries; make it abundant with comfort, so that poverty
shall disappear; keep it constant in the assertion
of Human Rights. And here we may fitly recall those
words of Antiquity, which Cicero quoted from the Greek,
and Webster in our day quoted from Cicero: “You have
a Sparta; adorn it.”<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<h4>SOURCES OF INFORMATION UPON RUSSIAN AMERICA.</h4>

<p>I am now brought to consider the character of these
possessions and their probable value. Here I am
obliged to confess a dearth of authentic information
easily accessible. Few among us read Russian, so that
works in this language are locked up from us. One of
these, in two large and showy volumes, is now before
me, entitled “An Historical Survey of the Formation
of the Russian-American Company, and its Progress to
the Present Time, by P. Teshmeneff, St. Petersburg.”
The first volume appeared in 1860, and the second
in 1863. Here, among other things, is a tempting engraving
of Sitka, wrapt in mists, with the sea before
and the snow-capped mountains darkened with forest
behind. Judging from the table of contents, which
has been translated for me by a Russian, the book
ought to be instructive. There is also another Russian
work of an official character, which appeared in
1861 at St. Petersburg, in the “Morskoi Sbornik,” or
Naval Review, and is entitled “Materials for the History
of the Russian Colonies on the Coasts of the
Pacific.” The report of Captain-Lieutenant Golowin,
made to the Grand Duke Constantine in 1861, with
which we have become acquainted through a scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
German journal, appeared originally in the same review.
These are recent productions. After the early
voyages of Behring, first ordered by Peter and supervised
by the Imperial Academy, the spirit of geographical
research seems to have subsided at St. Petersburg.
Other enterprises absorbed attention. And yet I would
not do injustice to the voyages of Billings, recounted
by Sauer, or of Lisiansky, or of Kotzebue, all under
the auspices of Russia, the last of which may compare
with any as a contribution to science. I may add
Lütke also; but Kotzebue was a worthy successor to
Behring and Cook.</p>

<p>Beside these official contributions, most of them by
no means fresh, are materials derived from casual navigators,
who, scudding these seas, rested in the harbors
as the water-fowl on its flight,&mdash;from whalemen, who
were there merely as Nimrods of the ocean, or from
adventurers in quest of the rich furs it furnished. There
are also the gazetteers and geographies; but they are
less instructive on this head than usual, being founded
on information now many years old.</p>

<p>Perhaps no region of equal extent on the globe, unless
we except the interior of Africa or possibly Greenland,
is so little known. Here I do not speak for myself
alone. A learned German, whom I have already
quoted, after saying that the explorations have been
limited to the coast, testifies that “the interior, not
only of the continent, but even of the island of Sitka,
is to this day unexplored, and is in every respect
<i>terra incognita</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The same has been repeated of the
other islands. Admiral Lütke, whose circumnavigation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of the globe began in 1826, and whose work bears date
1835-36, says of the Aleutian Archipelago, that, although
frequented for more than a century by Russian
vessels and those of other nations, it is to-day almost as
little known as in the time of Cook. Another writer of
authority, the compiler of the official work on the People
of Russia, published as late as 1862, speaks of the
interior as “a mystery.” And yet another says that our
ignorance with regard to this region would make it a
proper scene for a chapter of Gulliver’s Travels.</p>

<p>Where so little was known, invention found scope.
Imagination was made to supply the place of knowledge,
and poetry pictured the savage desolation in much
admired verse. Campbell, in the “Pleasures of Hope,”
while exploring “Earth’s loneliest bounds and Ocean’s
wildest shore,” reaches this region, which he portrays:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Lo! to the wintry winds the pilot yields</div>
<div class="verse">His bark careering o’er unfathomed fields.</div>
<div class="verse center">…</div>
<div class="verse">Now far he sweeps, where scarce a summer smiles,</div>
<div class="verse">On Behring’s rocks or Greenland’s naked isles;</div>
<div class="verse">Cold on his midnight watch the breezes blow</div>
<div class="verse">From wastes that slumber in eternal snow,</div>
<div class="verse">And waft across the waves’ tumultuous roar</div>
<div class="verse"><em>The wolf’s long howl from Oonalaska’s shore</em>.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">All of which, so far at least as it describes this region,
is inconsistent with truth. The poet ignores the isothermal
line, which plays such a conspicuous part on
the Pacific coast. Here the evidence is positive. Portlock,
the navigator, who was there toward the close of
the last century, after describing Cook’s Inlet, which
is several degrees north of Oonalaska, records his belief
“that the climate here is not so severe as has been
generally supposed; for, in the course of our traffic with
the natives, they frequently brought berries of several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
sorts, and in particular blackberries, equally fine with
those met with in England.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Kotzebue, who was here
later, says that he found “the weather pretty warm at
Oonalaska.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> South of the Aleutians the climate is
warmer still. The poet ignores natural history also, as
regards the distribution of animals. Curiously enough,
it does not appear that “wolves” exist on any of the
Fox Islands. Coxe, in his work on Russian Discoveries,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
records that “reindeer, bears, <em>wolves</em>, ice-foxes, are
not to be found on these islands.” But he was never
there. Meares, who was in those seas, says, “<em>The only
animals</em> on these islands are foxes, some of which are
black.”<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Cook, who visited Oonalaska twice, and once
made a prolonged stay, expressly says, “Foxes and weasels
were <em>the only quadrupeds</em> we saw; but they told
us that they had hares also, and marmottas.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> But
quadrupeds like these hardly sustain the exciting picture.
The same experienced navigator furnishes a
glimpse of the inhabitants, as they appeared to him,
which would make us tremble, if the “wolves” of the
poet were numerous. He says, “To all appearance, they
are the most peaceable, inoffensive people I ever met
with”; and Cook had been at Otaheite. “No such
thing as an offensive or even defensive weapon was
seen amongst the natives of Oonalaska.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Then, at
least, the inhabitants did not share the ferocity of the
“wolves” and of the climate. Another navigator fascinates
us by a description of the boats, which struck
him “with amazement beyond expression”; and he explains:
“If perfect symmetry, smoothness, and proportion
constitute beauty, they are beautiful; to me they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
appeared so beyond anything that I ever beheld. I
have seen some of them as transparent as oiled paper.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
But these are the very boats that buffet “the waves’
tumultuous roar,” while “the breezes” waft “the wolf’s
long howl.” The same reporter introduces another feature.
According to him, the sojourning Russians “seem
to have no desire to leave this place, where they enjoy
that indolence so pleasing to their minds.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The lotus-eaters
of Homer were no better off. The picture is
completed by another touch from Lütke. Admitting
the want of trees, the Admiral suggests that their place
is supplied not only by luxuriant grass, but by wood
thrown upon the coast, including trunks of camphor
from Chinese and Japanese waters, and “a tree which
gives forth the odor of the rose.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Such is a small
portion of the testimony, most of it in print before the
poet sang.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Nothing has been written about this region, whether
the coast or the islands, more authentic or interesting
than the narrative of Captain Cook on his third and
last voyage. He saw with intelligence, and his editor
has imparted to the description a clearness almost elegant.
The record of Captain Portlock’s voyage from
London to the Northwest Coast, in 1785-8, seems honest,
and is instructive. Captain Meares, whose voyage
was contemporaneous, saw and exposed the importance
of trade between the Northwest Coast and China.
Vancouver, who came a little later, has described some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
parts of the coast. La Pérouse, the unfortunate French
navigator, has afforded another picture of it, painted
with French colors. Before him was Maurelle, an officer
in the Spanish expedition of 1779, a portion of
whose journal is preserved in the Introduction to the
volumes of La Pérouse. After him was Marchand,
who, during a circumnavigation of the globe, stopped
here in 1791. The Voyage of the latter, published
in three quartos, is accompanied by an Historical Introduction,
which is a mine of information on all the
voyages to this coast. Then came the successive Russian
voyages already mentioned, and in 1804-6 the
“Voyage to the North Pacific” of Captain John D’Wolf,
one of our own enterprising countrymen. Later came
the “Voyage round the World” by Captain Sir Edward
Belcher, with a familiar sketch of life at Sitka, where
he stopped in 1837, and an engraving of the arsenal and
light-house there. Then followed the “Overland Journey
round the World,” in 1841-2, by Sir George Simpson,
Governor-in-chief of the Hudson’s Bay Company,
with an account of a visit to Sitka and the hospitality
of its governor. To these I add the “Nautical Magazine”
for 1849, Volume XVIII., which contains some
excellent pages about Sitka; the “Journal of the Royal
Geographical Society of London” for 1841, Volume XI.,
and for 1852, Volume XXII., where this region is
treated under the heads of “Observations on the Indigenous
Tribes of the Northwest Coast of America,”
and “Notes on the Distribution of Animals available
as Food in the Arctic Regions”; Burney’s “Northeastern
Voyages”; the magnificent work entitled “Description
Ethnographique des Peuples de la Russie,” which
appeared at St. Petersburg in 1862, on the tenth centennial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
anniversary of the foundation of the Russian
Empire; the very recent work of Murray on the “Geographical
Distribution of Mammals”; the work of Sir
John Richardson, “Fauna Boreali-Americana”; Latham
on “The Nationalities of Europe,” in the chapters on
the population of Russian America; the “Encyclopædia
Britannica,” and the admirable “Physical Atlas”
of Alexander Keith Johnston. I mention also an
elaborate article by Holmberg, in the Transactions
of the Finland Society of Sciences at Helsingfors, replete
with information on the Ethnography of the
Northwest Coast.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless the most precise and valuable information
has been contributed by Germany. The Germans are
the best of geographers; besides, many Russian contributions
are in German. Müller, who recorded the discoveries
of Behring, was a German. Nothing more
important on this subject has ever appeared than the
German work of the Russian Admiral Von Wrangell,
“Statistische und Ethnographische Nachrichten über
die Russischen Besitzungen an der Nordwestküste von
Amerika,” first published by Baer in his “Beiträge zur
Kenntniss des Russischen Reiches,” in 1839. There
is also the “Verhandlungen der Russisch-Kaiserlichen
Mineralogischen Gesellschaft zu St. Petersburg,” 1848
and 1849, which contains an elaborate article, in itself
a volume, on the Orography and Geology of the Northwest
Coast and the adjoining islands, at the end of
which is a bibliographical list of works and materials
illustrating the discovery and history of the western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
half of North America and the neighboring seas. I also
refer generally to the “Archiv für Wissenschaftliche
Kunde von Russland,” edited by Erman, but especially
the volume for 1863, containing the abstract of Golowin’s
report on the Russian Colonies in North America,
as it appeared originally in the “Morskoi Sbornik.” Besides
these, there are Wappäus, “Handbuch der Geographie
und Statistik von Nord-Amerika,” published
at Leipsic in 1855; Petermann, in his “Mittheilungen
über wichtige neue Erforschungen auf dem Gesammtgebiete
der Geographie,” for 1856, p. 486, for 1859, p. 41,
and for 1863, pp. 70, 237, 277; Kittlitz, “Denkwürdigkeiten
einer Reise nach dem Russischen Amerika, nach
Mikronesien und durch Kamtschatka,” published at Gotha
in 1858; also, by the same author, “The Vegetation
of the Coasts and Islands of the Pacific,” translated
from the German, and published at London in 1861.</p>

<p>Much recent information has been derived from the
great companies possessing the monopoly of trade. Latterly
there has been an unexpected purveyor in the
Russian American Telegraph Company, under the direction
of Captain Charles S. Bulkley; and here our
own countrymen help us. To this expedition we are
indebted for authentic evidence with regard to the character
of the region, and the great rivers which traverse
it. The Smithsonian Institution and the Chicago Academy
of Sciences coöperated with the Telegraph Company
in the investigation of the natural history. Major
Kennicott, a young naturalist, originally in the service
of the Institution, and Director of the Museum of the
Chicago Academy, was the enterprising chief of the
Yukon division of the expedition. While in the midst
of his valuable labors, he died suddenly, in the month of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
May last, at Nulato, on the banks of the great river, the
Kwichpak, which may be called the Mississippi of the
North, far away in the interior, and on the confines of
the Arctic Circle, where the sun was visible all night.
Even after death he was still an explorer. From this
remote outpost, his remains, after descending the unknown
river in an Esquimaux boat of seal-skins, steered
by the faithful companion of his labors, were transported
by way of Panama to his home at Chicago,
where he now lies buried. Such an incident cannot
be forgotten, and his name will always remind us of
courageous enterprise, before which distance and difficulty
disappeared. He was not a beginner, when he
entered into the service of the Telegraph Company.
Already he had visited the Yukon country by the way
of the Mackenzie River, and contributed to the Smithsonian
Institution important information with regard
to its geography and natural history, some of which is
found in their Reports. Nature in novel forms was
open to him. The birds here maintained their kingdom.
All about him was the mysterious breeding-place
of the canvas-back duck, whose eggs, never before seen
by naturalist, covered acres.</p>

<p>If we look to maps for information, here again we
are disappointed. Latterly the coast is outlined and
described with reasonable completeness; so also are
the islands. This is the contribution of navigators and
of recent Russian charts. But the interior is little more
than a blank, calling to mind “the unhabitable downs,”
where, according to Swift, the old geographers “place
elephants for want of towns.” I have already referred
to what purports to be a “General Map of the Russian
Empire,” published by the Academy of Sciences at St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Petersburg in 1776, and republished at London in 1780,
where Russian America does not appear. I might mention
also that Captain Cook complained in his day of
the Russian maps as “singularly erroneous.” On the
return of the expedition, English maps recorded his explorations
and the names he assigned to different parts
of the coast. These were reproduced in St. Petersburg,
and the Russian copy was then reproduced in London,
so that geographical knowledge was very little advanced.
Some of the best maps of this region are by Germans,
who excel in maps. I mention an excellent one of the
Aleutian Islands and the neighboring coasts, especially
to illustrate their orography and geology, which will
be found at the end of the volume of Transactions of
the Imperial Mineralogical Society at St. Petersburg to
which I have already referred.</p>

<p>Late maps attest the tardiness of information. Here,
for instance, is an excellent map of North America, purporting
to be published by the Geographical Institute
of Weimar as late as 1859, on which we have the Yukon
pictured, very much like the Niger in Africa, as a
large river meandering in the interior with no outlet
to the sea. Here also is a Russian map of this very region,
as late as 1861, where the course of the Yukon
is left in doubt. On other maps, as in the Physical
Atlas of Keith Johnston, it is presented, under another
name, entering into the Frozen Ocean. But the
secret is penetrated at last. Recent discovery, by the
enterprise of our citizens in the service of the Telegraph
Company, fixes that this river is an affluent of the
Kwichpak, as the Missouri is an affluent of the Mississippi,
and enters into Behring Sea by many mouths,
between the parallels of 62° and 63°. After the death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of Major Kennicott, a division of his party, with nothing
but a skin boat, ascended the river to Fort Yukon,
where it bifurcates, and descended it again to Nulato,
thus establishing the entire course from its sources in
the Rocky Mountains for a distance exceeding a thousand
miles. I have before me now an outline map just
prepared by our Coast Survey, where this correction is
made. But this is only a harbinger of the maturer
labors of our accomplished bureau, when the coasts of
this region are under the jurisdiction of the United
States.</p>

<p>In closing this abstract of authorities, being the chief
sources of original information, I cannot forbear expressing
my satisfaction, that, with the exception of a single
work, all these are found in the Congressional Library,
now so happily enriched by the rare collection of the
Smithsonian Institution. Sometimes individuals are
like libraries; and this seems to be illustrated in the
case of Professor Baird, of the Smithsonian Institution,
who is thoroughly informed on all questions connected
with the natural history of Russian America, and also
of George Gibbs, Esq., now of Washington, who is the
depositary of valuable knowledge, the result of his own
personal studies and observations, with regard to the
native races.</p>

<h4>CHARACTER AND VALUE OF RUSSIAN AMERICA.</h4>

<p>I pass now to a consideration of the character and
value of these possessions, as seen under these different
heads: first, Government; secondly, Population;
thirdly, Climate; fourthly, Vegetable Products; fifthly,
Mineral Products; sixthly, Furs; and, seventhly, Fisheries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Of these I shall speak briefly in their order.
There are certain words of a general character, which
I introduce by way of preface. I quote from Blodget on
the “Climatology of the United States and of the Temperate
Latitudes of the North American Continent.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is most surprising that so little is known of the great
islands and the long line of coast from Puget’s Sound to
Sitka, ample as its resources must be even for recruiting the
transient commerce of the Pacific, independent of its immense
intrinsic value. To the region bordering the Northern
Pacific the finest maritime positions belong throughout its
entire extent; and no part of the West of Europe exceeds it
in the advantages of equable climate, fertile soil, and commercial
accessibility of the coast. The western slope of the
Rocky Mountain system may be included as a part of this
maritime region, embracing an immense area, from the forty-fifth
to the sixtieth parallel and five degrees of longitude in
width. The cultivable surface of this district cannot be
much less than three hundred thousand square miles.”<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

</div>

<p>From this sketch, which is in the nature of a picture,
I pass to the different heads.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. <i>Government.</i>&mdash;The Russian settlements were for
a long time without any regular government. They
were little more than temporary lodgements for purposes
of trade, where the will of the stronger prevailed.
The natives, who had enslaved each other, became in
turn the slaves of these mercenary adventurers. Captain
Cook records “the great subjection”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> of the natives
at Oonalaska, when he was there in 1778; and a Russian
navigator, fourteen years later, describes the islands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
generally as “under the sway of roving hunters more
savage than any tribes he had hitherto met with.”<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> At
Oonalaska the Russians for a long time employed all
the men in the chase, “taking the fruits of their labor
to themselves.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The first trace of government which I find was in
1790, at the important island of Kadiak, or the Great
Island, as it was called, where a Russian company was
established under direction of a Greek by the name
of Delareff, who, according to the partial report of a
Russian navigator, “governed with the strictest justice,
as well natives as Russians, and established a school,
where the young natives were taught the Russian language,
reading and writing.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Here were about fifty
Russians, including officers of the company, and another
person described as “there on the part of Government
to collect tribute.”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The establishment consisted of five
houses after the Russian fashion,&mdash;barracks laid out on
either side, somewhat like the boxes at a coffee-house,
with different offices, represented as follows: “An office
of appeal, to settle disputes, levy fines, and punish offenders
by a regular trial; here Delareff presides, and
I believe that few courts of justice pass a sentence
with more impartiality; an office of receival and delivery,
both for the company and for tribute; the commissaries’
department, for the distribution of the regulated
portions of provision; counting-house, &amp;c.: all in this
building, at one end of which is Delareff’s habitation.”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
If this picture is not overdrawn,&mdash;and it surely is,&mdash;affairs
here did not improve with time. But D’Wolf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
who was there in 1805-6, reports “about forty houses
of various descriptions, including a church, school-house,
store-house, and barracks”; and he adds: “The school-house
was quite a respectable establishment, well filled
with pupils.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>There were various small companies, of which that
at Kadiak was the most considerable, all finally fused
into one large trading company, known as the Russian
American Company, organized in 1799, under a charter
from the Emperor Paul, with the power of administration
throughout the whole region, including coasts
and islands. In this respect it was not unlike the East
India Company, which has played such a part in English
history; but it may be more properly compared
to the Hudson’s Bay Company, of which it was a Russian
counterpart. The charter was for a term of years,
but it has been from time to time extended, and, as I
understand, is now about to expire. The powers of the
Company are sententiously described by the “Almanach
de Gotha” for 1867, where, under the head of Russia,
it says that “to the present time Russian America has
been the property of a company.”</p>

<p>I know no limitation upon the Company, except that
latterly it has been bound to appoint its chief functionary,
called “Administrator General,” from the higher
officers of the imperial navy, when he becomes invested
with what are declared the prerogatives of a governor
in Siberia. This requirement has doubtless secured the
superior order of magistrates since enjoyed. Among
these have been Baron Wrangell, an admiral, there at
the time of the treaty with Great Britain in 1825; Captain
Kuprianoff, who had commanded the Azof, a ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of the line, in the Black Sea, and spoke English well;
Captain Etolin; Admiral Furuhelm, who, after being
there five years, was made governor of the province of
the Amoor; Admiral Woiwodsky; and Prince Maksutoff,
an admiral also, who is the present Administrator
General. The term of service is ordinarily five years.</p>

<p>The seat of government is the town of New Archangel,
better known by its aboriginal name of Sitka,
with a harbor as smooth and safe as a pond. Its present
population cannot be far from one thousand, although
even this is changeable. In spring, when sailors
leave for the sea and trappers for the chase, it has
been reduced to as few as one hundred and eighty. It
was not without a question that Sitka at last prevailed
as the metropolis. Lütke sets forth reasons elaborately
urged in favor of St. Paul, on the island of Kadiak.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The first settlement there was in 1800, by Baranoff,
the superintendent of the Company, whose life was
passed in this country, and whose name has been given
to the island. But the settlement made slow progress.
Lisiansky, who was there in 1804, records, that, “from
his entrance into Sitka Sound, there was not to be seen
on the shore the least vestige of habitation.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The natives
had set themselves against a settlement. Meanwhile
the seat of government was at Kadiak, of which
we have an early and friendly glimpse. I quote what
Lisiansky says, as exhibiting in a favorable light the
beginning of the government, now transferred to the
United States.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The island of Kadiak, with the rest of the Russian settlements
along the northwest coast of America, are superintended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
by a kind of governor-general or commander-in-chief,
who has agents under him, appointed, like himself, by
the Company at Petersburg. The smaller settlements have
each a Russian overseer. These overseers are chosen by the
governor, and are selected for the office in consequence of
their long services and orderly conduct. They have the
power of punishing, to a certain extent, those whom they
superintend; but are themselves amenable to the governor,
if they abuse their power by acts of injustice. The seat of
government is the Harbor of St. Paul, which has a barrack,
different store-houses, several respectable wooden habitations,
and a church, the only one to be found on the
coast.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

</div>

<p>From this time the Company seems to have established
itself on the coast. Lisiansky speaks of a single
hunting party of nine hundred men, gathered from
different places, as Alaska, Kadiak, Cook’s Inlet, Prince
William Sound, and “commanded by thirty-six <i>toyons</i>,
who are subordinate to the Russians in the service of
the American Company, and receive from them their
orders.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> From another source I learn that the inhabitants
of Kadiak and of the Aleutian Islands were
regarded as “immediate subjects of the Company,”&mdash;the
males from eighteen to fifty being bound to serve
it for the term of three years each. They were employed
in the chase. The population of Alaska and
of the two great bays, Cook’s Inlet and Prince William
Sound, were also subject to the Company; but
they were held to a yearly tax on furs, without regular
service, and they could trade only with the Company;
otherwise they were independent. This seems
to have been before a division of the whole into districts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
all under the Company, which, though primarily
for the business of the Company, may be regarded as
so many distinct jurisdictions, each with local powers
of government.</p>

<p>Among these were two districts which I mention
only to put aside, as not included in the present cession:
(1.) the Kurile Islands, being the group nestling
near the coast of Japan, on the Asiatic side of the
dividing line between the two continents; (2.) the
Ross settlement in California, now abandoned.</p>

<p>There remain five other districts: (1.) the District
of Atcha, with the bureau at this island, embracing
the two western groups of the Aleutians known as
the Andreanoffsky Islands and the Rat Islands, and
also the group about Behring’s Island, which is not
embraced in the present cession;&mdash;(2.) the District
of Oonalaska, with the bureau at this island, embracing
the Fox Islands, the peninsula of Alaska to the meridian
of the Shumagin Islands, including these, and
also the Pribyloff Islands to the northwest of the
peninsula;&mdash;(3.) the District of Kadiak, embracing the
peninsula of Alaska east of the meridian of the Shumagin
Islands, and the coast eastward to Mount St.
Elias, with adjacent islands, including Kadiak, Cook’s
Inlet, and Prince William Sound; then northward along
the coast of Bristol Bay, and the country watered by
the Nushagak and Kuskokwim rivers; all of which
is governed from Kadiak, with redoubts or palisaded
stations at Nushagak, Cook’s Inlet, and Prince William
Sound;&mdash;(4.) the Northern District, embracing
the country of the Kwichpak and of Norton Sound,
under direction of the commander of the redoubt at
St. Michael’s; leaving the country northward, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the islands St. Lawrence and St. Matthew, not included
in this district, but visited directly from Sitka;&mdash;(5.)
the District of Sitka, embracing the coast
from Mount St. Elias, where the Kadiak district ends,
southward to the latitude of 54° 40´, with adjacent
islands. But this district has been curtailed by a lease
of the Russian American Company in 1839 for the
space of ten years, and subsequently renewed, where
this Company, in consideration of the annual payment
of two thousand otter skins of Columbia River, under-lets
to the Hudson Bay Company all its franchise for
the strip of continent between Cape Spencer at the
north and the latitude of 54° 40´, excluding adjacent
islands.</p>

<p>The central government of all these districts is at
Sitka, from which emanate all orders and instructions.
Here also is the chief factory, the fountain of supplies
and the store-house of proceeds.</p>

<p>The operations of the Government are seen in receipts
and expenditures, including salaries and allowances.
In the absence of a complete series of such
statistics to the present time, I mass together what I
have been able to glean in different fields, relating to
particular years, knowing well its unsatisfactory character.
But each item has instruction for us.</p>

<p>The capital of the Company, in buildings, wares, vessels,
&amp;c., was reported in 1833 at 3,658,577 rubles. In
1838 it possessed twelve vessels, with an aggregate
capacity of 1,556 tons, most of which were built at
Sitka. According to Wappäus, who follows Wrangell,
the pay of the officers and workmen in 1832
amounted to 442,877 rubles. At that time the persons
in its service numbered 1,025, of whom 556 were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Russians, 152 Creoles, and 317 Aleutians. In 1851
there were one staff officer, three officers of the imperial
navy, one officer of engineers, four civil officers,
thirty religious officers, and six hundred and eighty-six
servants. The expenses from 1826 to 1833, a
period of seven years, were 6,608,077 rubles. These
become interesting, when it is considered, that, besides
what was paid on account of furs and the support
of persons in the service of the Company, were
other items incident to government, such as ship-building,
navigation, fortifications, hospitals, schools, and
churches. From a later authority it appears that the
receipts reported at St. Petersburg for the year 1855
were 832,749 rubles, against expenses, 683,892 rubles,
incurred for “administration in Russia and the colonies,”
insurance, transportation, and duties. The relative
proportion of these different expenses does not
appear.</p>

<p>These are explained by other statistics, which I am
able to give from the Report of Golowin, who furnishes
the receipts and expenditures from 1850 to
1859, inclusive. The silver ruble, which is the money
employed in the table, is taken at our mint for seventy-five
cents.</p>

<p>Analyzing this table, we arrive at a clearer insight
into the affairs of the Company. If its receipts have
been considerable, they have been subject to serious
deductions. From the expenditures we also learn something
of the obligations we are about to assume.</p>

<p>Another table shows that during this same period
122,006 rubles were received for ice, mostly sent to
California, 26,399 rubles for timber, and 6,250 for
coal. I think it not improbable that these items are
included in the list of “receipts” under the term
“other traffics.”</p>

<p>In Russia the churches belong to the Government,
and this rule prevails in these districts, where are four
Greek churches and five Greek chapels. There is also
a Protestant church at Sitka. I am glad to add that
at the latter place there is a public library, which some
years ago contained seventeen hundred volumes, together
with journals, charts, atlases, mathematical and
astronomical instruments. In Atcha, Oonalaska, Kadiak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
and Sitka schools are reported at the expense
of the Company, though not on a very comprehensive
scale; for Admiral Wrangell mentions only ninety boys
as enjoying these advantages in 1839. In Oonalaska and
Kadiak there were at the same time orphan asylums for
girls, where there were in all about thirty; but the
Admiral adds, that “these useful institutions will, without
doubt, be improved to the utmost.” Besides these,
which are confined to particular localities, there is said
to be a hospital near every factory in all the districts.</p>

<p>I have no means of knowing if these territorial subdivisions
have undergone recent modification. They
will be found in the “Russischen Besitzungen” of
Wrangell, published in 1839, in the “Geographie” of
Wappäus in 1856, and in the “Archiv von Russland”
of 1863, containing the article on the Report of Golowin.
I am thus particular with regard to them from a
double motive. Besides helping us to understand the
government, they afford suggestions of practical importance
in any future organization.</p>

<p>The Company has not been without criticism. Pictures
of it are by no means rose color. These, too, furnish
instruction. Early in the century its administration
was the occasion of open and repeated complaint.
It was pronounced harsh and despotic. Langsdorff is
indignant that “a free trading company should exist
independent, as it were, of the Government, not confined
within any definite regulations, but who can exercise
their authority free and uncontrolled, nay, even
unpunished, over so vast an extent of country.” In
stating the case, he adds, that “the Russian subject
here enjoys no protection of his property, lives in no
security, and, if oppressed, has no one to whom he can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
apply for justice. The agents of the factories, and their
subordinate officers, influenced by humor or interest, decide
everything arbitrarily.” And this arbitrary power
seems to have prevailed wherever a factory was established.
“The stewardship in each single establishment
is entirely despotic; though nominally depending upon
the principal factory at Kadiak, these stewards do just
what they please, without the possibility of their being
called to account.” If such was the condition of Russians,
what must have been that of natives? Here
the witness answers: “I have seen the Russian fur-hunters
dispose of the lives of the natives solely according
to their own arbitrary will, and put these defenceless
creatures to death in the most horrible manner.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
Our own D’Wolf records Langsdorff’s remonstrance in
behalf of “the poor Russians,” and adds that it was
“but to little purpose.”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Krusenstern concurs in this
testimony, and, if possible, darkens the colors. According
to him, “Every one must obey the iron rule of the
agent of the American Company; nor can there be
either personal property or individual security, where
there are no laws. The chief agent of the American
Company is the boundless despot over an extent of country
which, comprising the Aleutian Islands, stretches
from 57° to 61° of latitude and from 130° to 190° of
east longitude”; and he adds, in a note, “There are no
courts of justice in Kadiak, nor any of the Company’s
possessions.”<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Chamisso, the naturalist of Kotzebue’s
expedition, while confessing incompetency to speak on
the treatment of the natives by the Company, declares
“his wounded feelings and his commiseration.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
too probable that the melancholy story of our own aborigines
has been repeated. As these criticisms were by
Russian officers, they must have had a certain effect.
I cannot believe that the recent government, administered
by the enlightened magistrates of whom we
have heard, has been obnoxious to such terrible accusations;
nor must it be forgotten that the report of Lisiansky,
contemporaneous with those of Langsdorff and
Krusenstern, is much less painful.</p>

<p>Baranoff, who had been so long superintendent, retired
in 1818. He is much praised by Langsdorff, who
saw him in 1805-6, and by Lütke, who was at Sitka
in 1828. Both attribute to him a genius for his place,
and a disinterested devotion to the interests of the
Company, whose confidence he enjoyed to the end.
D’Wolf says, “He possessed a strong mind, easy manners
and deportment,” and “commanded the greatest
respect from the Indians.”<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Although administering
affairs for more than a generation without rendering
accounts, he died poor. He was succeeded by Captain
Hagemeister. Since then, according to Lütke, an
infinity of reforms has taken place, by which order and
system have been introduced.</p>

<p>The Russian officer, Captain Golowin, who visited
these possessions in 1860, has recommended certain institutional
reforms, which are not without interest at
this time. His recommendations concern the governor
and the people. According to him, the governor should
be appointed by the Crown with the concurrence of
the Company, removable only when his continuance is
plainly injurious to the colony; he should be subject
only to the Crown, and his powers should be limited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
especially in regard to the natives; he should provide
protection for the colonists by means of cruisers, and
should personally visit every district annually; the colonists,
Creoles, and subject natives, such as the Aleutians,
should be governed by magistrates of their own
selection; the name of “free Creole” should cease; all
disputes should be settled by the local magistrates, unless
the parties desire an appeal to the governor; schools
should be encouraged, and, if necessary, provided at the
public expense. These suggestions, in the nature of a
reform bill, foreshadow a condition of self-government
in harmony with republican institutions.</p>

<p>It is evident that these Russian settlements, distributed
through an immense region and far from any civilized
neighborhood, have little in common with those
of European nations elsewhere, unless we except the
Danish on the west coast of Greenland. Nearly all
are on the coast or the islands. They are nothing but
“villages” or “factories” under protection of palisades.
Sitka is an exception, due unquestionably to its selection
as headquarters of the Government, and also to
the eminent character of the governors who have made
it their home. The executive mansion and the social
life there have been described by recent visitors, who
acknowledged the charms of politeness on this distant
northwestern coast. Lütke portrays life among its fogs,
and especially the attractions of the governor’s house.
This was in the time of Admiral Wrangell, whose wife,
possessing a high education, embellished the wilderness
by her presence, and furnished an example of a refined
and happy household. His account of Sitkan hospitality
differs in some respects from that of English writers
who succeeded. He records that fish was the staple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
dish at the tables of functionaries as well as of the
poor, and that the chief functionary himself was rarely
able to have meat for dinner. During the winter, a species
of wild sheep, the Musmon or Argali, also known
in Siberia, and hunted in the forests, furnished an occasional
supply. But a fish diet did not prevent his
house from being delightful,&mdash;as was that of Baranoff,
at an earlier day, according to D’Wolf, who speaks of
“an abundance of good cheer.”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Sir Edward Belcher, the English circumnavigator,
while on his voyage round the world, stopped there.
From him we have an account of the executive mansion
and fortifications, which will not be out of place
in this attempt to portray the existing Government.
The house is of wood, described as “solid,” one hundred
and forty feet in length by seventy feet wide, of
two stories, with lofts, capped by a light-house in the
centre of the roof, which is covered with sheet-iron. It
is about sixty feet above the sea-level, and completely
commands all the anchorage in the neighborhood. Behind
is a line of picketed logs twenty-five feet in height,
flanked at the angles by block-houses, loopholed and
furnished with small guns and swivels. The fortifications,
when complete, “will comprise five sides, upon
which forty pieces of cannon will be mounted, principally
old ship-guns, varying from twelve to twenty-four
pounders.” The arsenal is praised for the best of
cordage in ample store, and for the best of artificers in
every department. The interior of the Greek church
was found to be “splendid, quite beyond conception in
such a place as this.” The school and hospital had
a “comparative cleanliness and comfort, and much to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
admire,&mdash;although a man-of-war’s man’s ideas of cleanliness
are perhaps occasionally acute.” But it is the
social life which seems to have most surprised the gallant
captain. After telling us that “on their Sunday
all the officers of the establishment, civil as well as
military, dine at the governor’s,” he introduces us to
an evening party and dance, which the latter gave
to show his English guest “the female society of Sitka,”
and records that everything “passed most delightfully,”
especially, that, “although the ladies were almost self-taught,
they acquitted themselves with all the ease and
elegance communicated by European instruction.” Sir
Edward adds, that “the society is indebted principally
to the governor’s elegant and accomplished lady&mdash;who
is of one of the first Russian families&mdash;for much of
this polish”; and he describes sympathetically her long
journey through Siberia with her husband, “on horse-back
or mules, enduring great hardships, in a most critical
moment, in order to share with him the privations
of this barbarous region.” But, according to him, barbarism
is disappearing; and he concludes by declaring
that “the whole establishment appears to be rapidly
on the advance, and at no distant period we may hear
of a trip to Norfolk Sound through America as little
more than a summer excursion.”<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Is not this time
near at hand?</p>

<p>Four years afterward, Sir George Simpson, governor-in-chief
of the Hudson’s Bay Company, on his overland
journey round the world, stopped at Sitka. He
had just crossed the continent by way of the Red River
settlements to Vancouver. He, too, seems to have been
pleased. He shows us in the harbor “five sailing vessels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
ranging between two hundred and three hundred
and fifty tons, besides a large bark in the offing in tow
of a steamer”; and he carries us to the executive mansion,
already described, which reappears as “a suite of
apartments, communicating, according to the Russian
fashion, with each other, all the public rooms being
handsomely decorated and richly furnished, commanding
a view of the whole establishment, which was in
fact a little village, while about half-way down the rock
two batteries on terraces frowned respectively over the
land and the water.” There was another Administrator-General
since the visit of Sir Edward Belcher; but
again the wife plays her charming part. After portraying
her as a native of Helsingfors, in Finland, the
visitor adds: “So that this pretty and ladylike woman
had come to this, her secluded home, from the farthest
extremity of the Empire.” Evidently in a mood beyond
contentment, he says: “We sat down to a good
dinner in the French style, the party, in addition to
our host and hostess and ourselves, comprising twelve
of the Company’s officers”; and his final judgment
seems to be given, when he says: “The good folks of
New Archangel appear to live well. The surrounding
country abounds in the chevreuil, the finest meat that
I ever ate, with the single exception of moose,” while
“in a little stream which is within a mile of the fort
salmon are so plentiful at the proper season, that, when
ascending the river, they have been known literally to
embarrass the movements of a canoe.”<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Such is the
testimony.</p>

<p>With these concluding pictures I turn from the Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>2. <i>Population.</i>&mdash;I come now to the Population,
which may be considered in its numbers and in its
character. In neither respect, perhaps, can it add
much to the value of the country, except so far as
native hunters and trappers are needed for the supply
of furs. Professor Agassiz touches this point in
a letter which I have just received from him, where
he says: “To me the fact that there is as yet hardly
any population would have great weight, as this secures
the settlement to our race.” But we ought to
know something, at least, of the people about to become
the subjects of our jurisdiction, if not our fellow-citizens.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> In trying to arrive at an idea of their <em>numbers</em>,
I begin with Lippincott’s Gazetteer, as it is the
most accessible, according to which the whole population
in 1851, aboriginal, Russian, and Creole, was
61,000. The same estimate appears also in the London
“Imperial Gazetteer” and in the “Geographie” of
Wappäus. Keith Johnston, in his “Physical Atlas,”
calls the population, in 1852, 66,000. McCulloch, in
the last edition of his “Geographical Dictionary,” puts
it as high as 72,375. On the other hand, the “Almanach
de Gotha” for the present year calls it 54,000.
This estimate seems to have been adopted substantially
from the great work, “Les Peuples de la Russie,” which
I am disposed to consider as the best authority.</p>

<p>Exaggerations are common with regard to the inhabitants
of newly acquired possessions, and this distant
region is no exception. An enthusiastic estimate once
placed its population as high as 400,000. Long ago,
Schelekoff, an early Russian adventurer, reported that he
had subjected to the Crown of Russia 50,000 persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
in the island of Kadiak alone.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> But Lisiansky, who followed
him there in 1804-5, says: “The population of
this island, when compared with its size, is very small.”
After “the minutest research,” he found that it amounted
only to 4,000 souls.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> It is much less now,&mdash;probably
not more than 1,500.</p>

<p>It is easy to know the number of those within the
immediate jurisdiction of the Company. This is determined
by a census. Even here the aborigines are the
most numerous. Then come the Creoles, and last the
Russians. But here you must bear in mind a distinction
with regard to the former. In Spanish America
all of European parentage born there are “Creoles”;
in Russian America this term is applicable only to
those whose parents are European and native,&mdash;in
other words, “half-breeds.” According to Wrangell, in
1833, the census of dependants of the Company in all
its districts was 652 Russians, 991 Creoles, and 9,016
Aleutians and Kadiaks, being in all 10,659. Of these,
5,509 were men and 5,150 were women. In 1851,
according to the report of the Company, there was an
increase of Creoles, with a corresponding diminution
of Russians and aborigines, being 505 Russians, 1,703
Creoles, and 7,055 aborigines, in all 9,263. In 1857
there were 644 Russians, 1,903 Creoles, and 7,245 aborigines,
in all 9,792, of whom 5,133 were men and
4,659 were women. The increase from 1851 to 1857
was only 529, or about one per cent. annually. In
1860 there were “some hundreds” of Russians, 2,000
Creoles, and 8,000 aborigines, amounting in all to
10,540, of whom 5,382 were men and 5,158 were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
women. I am thus particular, that you may see how
stationary population has been even within the sphere
of the Company.</p>

<p>The number of Russians and Creoles at the present
time in the whole colony cannot be more than 2,500.
The number of aborigines under the direct government
of the Company may be 8,000. There remain also the
mass of aborigines outside the jurisdiction of the Company,
and having only a temporary or casual contact
with it for purposes of trade. In this respect they are
not unlike the aborigines of the United States while in
their tribal condition, described so often as “Indians
not taxed.” For the number of these outside aborigines
I prefer to follow the authority of the recent work already
quoted, “Les Peuples de la Russie,” according to
which they are estimated at between forty and fifty
thousand.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> In speaking of <em>character</em>, I turn to a different
class of materials. The early Russians here were
not Pilgrims. They were mostly runaways, fleeing from
justice. Langsdorff says, “The greater part of the Promüschleniks
and inferior officers of the different settlements
are Siberian criminals, malefactors, and adventurers
of various kinds.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The single and exclusive
business of the Promüschleniks was the collection of
furs. But the name very early acquired a bad odor.
Here again we have the same Russian authority, who,
after saying that the inhabitants of the distant islands
are under the superintendence of a Promüschlenik,
adds,&mdash;“which is, in other words, under that of a
rascal, by whom they are oppressed, tormented, and
plundered in every possible way.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> It must be remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
that this authentic portrait is not of our
day.</p>

<p>The aborigines are all, in common language, Esquimaux;
but they differ essentially from the Esquimaux
of Greenland, and they also differ among themselves.
Though popularly known by this family name, they
have as many divisions and subdivisions, with as many
languages and idioms, as France once had. There are
large groups, each with its own nationality and language;
and there are smaller groups, each with its
tribal idiom. In short, the great problem of Language
is repeated here. Its forms seem to be infinite. Scientific
inquiry traces many to a single root, but practically
they are different. Here is that confusion of
tongues which yields only to the presence of civilization;
and it becomes more remarkable, as the idiom is
often confined to so small a circle.</p>

<p>Looking at them ethnographically, we find two principal
groups or races,&mdash;the first scientifically known
as Esquimaux, and the second as Indians. By another
nomenclature, having the sanction of authority and
usage, they are divided into Esquimaux, Aleutians,
Kenaians, and Koloschians, being four distinct groups.
The Esquimaux and Aleutians are reported Mongolian
in origin. According to doubtful theory, they passed
from Asia to America by the succession of islands beginning
on the coast of Japan and extending to Alaska,
which for this purpose became a bridge between the
two continents. The Kenaians and Koloschians are
Indians, belonging to known American races. So that
these four groups are ethnographically resolved into
two, and the two are resolved popularly into one.</p>

<p>There are general influences more or less applicable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
to all these races. The climate is peculiar, and the
natural features of the country are commanding. Cool
summers and mild winters are favorable to the huntsman
and fisherman. Lofty mountains, volcanic forms,
large rivers, numerous islands, and an extensive sea-coast
constitute the great Book of Nature for all to read.
None are dull. Generally they are quick, intelligent,
and ingenious, excelling in the chase and in navigation,
managing a boat as the rider his horse, until man
and boat seem to be one. Some are very skilful with
tools, and exhibit remarkable taste. The sea is bountiful,
and the land has its supplies. From these they
are satisfied. Better still, there is something in their
nature which does not altogether reject the improvements
of civilization. Unlike our Indians, they are
willing to learn. By a strange superstition, which still
continues, these races derive descent from different animals.
Some are gentle and pacific; others are warlike.
All, I fear, are slaveholders; some are cruel task-masters;
others, in the interior, are reputed cannibals.
But the country back from the sea-coast is still an undiscovered
secret.</p>

<p>(1.) Looking at them in ethnographical groups, I begin
with the <i>Esquimaux</i>, who popularly give the name
to the whole. They number about 17,000, and stretch
along the indented coast from its eastern limit on the
Frozen Ocean to the mouth of the Copper River, in 60°
north latitude, excluding the peninsula of Alaska, occupied
by Aleutians, and the peninsula of Kenai, occupied
by Kenaians. More powerful races, of Indian origin,
following the courses of the great rivers northward
and westward, have gradually crowded the Esquimaux
from the interior, until they constitute a belt on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
salt water, including the islands of the coast, and especially
Kadiak. Their various dialects are traced to a
common root, while the prevailing language betrays an
affinity with the Esquimaux of Greenland, and the intervening
country watered by the Mackenzie. They
share the characteristics of that extensive family, which,
besides spreading across the continent, occupies an extent
of sea-coast greater than any other people of the
globe, from which their simple navigation has sallied
forth so as to give them the name of Phœnicians of
the North. Words exclusively belonging to the Esquimaux
are found in the dialects of other races completely
strangers, as Phœnician sounds are observed in the
Celtic speech of Ireland.</p>

<p>The most known of the Russian Esquimaux is the
small tribe now remaining on the island of Kadiak,
which from the beginning has been a centre of trade.
Although by various intermixture they already approach
the Indians of the coast, losing the Asiatic type,
their speech remains a distinctive sign of race. They
are Esquimaux, and I describe them in order to present
an idea of this people.</p>

<p>The men are tall, with copper skins, small black
eyes, flat faces, and teeth of dazzling whiteness. Once
the women pierced the nostrils, the lower lip, and the
ears, for ornaments; but now only the nostrils suffer.
The aboriginal costume is still preserved, especially out
of doors. Their food is mostly from the sea, without
the roots or berries which the island supplies. The
flesh and oil of the whale are a special luxury. The
oil is drunk pure, or used to season other food. Accustomed
to prolonged abstinence, they exhibit at times an
appetite amounting to prodigy. In one night six men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
were able to devour the whole of a large bear. A strong
drink made from the strawberry and myrtle, producing
the effect of opium, has yielded to brandy. Sugar and
tea are highly esteemed; but snuff is a delight. Lisiansky
records that they would go out of the way twenty
miles merely for a pinch.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> They have tools of their
own, which they use with skill. Their baidars, or canoes,
are distinguished for completeness of finish and
beauty of form. Unlike those of the Koloschians, lower
down on the coast, which are hollowed from trunks of
trees, they are of seal-skins stretched on frames, with
a single aperture in the covering to receive the person
of the master. The same skill appears in the carving
of wood, whalebone, and walrus-ivory. Their general
mode of life is said to be like that of other tribes on
the coast. To all else they add knowledge of the healing
art and passion for gaming.</p>

<p>Opposite Kadiak, on the main-land east, are the
Tchugatchi, a kindred tribe, speaking the same language,
but a different dialect. Northward is a succession
of kindred tribes, differing in speech, and each
with local peculiarities, but all are represented as kind,
courteous, hospitable, and merry. It is a good sign,
that merriment should prevail. Their tribal names are
derived from a neighboring river, or some climatic circumstance.
Thus, for instance, those on the mighty
Kwichpak have the name of Kwichpakmutes, or “inhabitants
of the great river.” Those on Bristol Bay are
called by their cousins of Norton Sound Achkugmutes,
or “inhabitants of the warm country”; and the same
designation is applied to the Kadiaks. Warmth, like
other things in this world, is comparative; and to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Esquimaux at 64° north latitude another five degrees
further south is in a “warm country.” These northern
tribes have been visited lately by our Telegraphic
Exploring Expedition, which reports especially their
geographical knowledge and good disposition. As the
remains of Major Kennicott descended the Kwichpak,
they were not without sympathy from the natives. Curiosity
also had its part. At a village where the boat
rested for the night, the chief announced that it was
the first time white men had ever been seen there.</p>

<p>(2.) The <i>Aleutians</i>, sometimes called Western Esquimaux,
number about 3,000. By a plain exaggeration,
Knight, in his Cyclopædia of Geography, makes
them 20,000. Their home is the archipelago of volcanic
islands whose name they bear, and also a portion
of the contiguous peninsula of Alaska. The well-defined
type has already disappeared; but the national
dress continues. This is a long shirt with tight sleeves,
made from the skins of birds, either the sea-parrot or
the diver. This dress, called the <i>parka</i>, is indispensable
as clothing, blanket, and even as habitation, during a
voyage, being a complete shelter against wind and cold.
They, too, are fishermen and huntsmen; but they seem
to excel as artificers. The instruments and utensils of
the Oonalaskans have been noted for beauty. Their
baidars were pronounced by Sauer “infinitely superior
to those of any other island,”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and another navigator
declares them “the best means yet discovered to go
from place to place, either upon the deepest or the shallowest
water, in the quickest, easiest, and safest manner
possible.”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> These illustrate their nature, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
finer than that of their neighbors. They are at home
on the water, and excite admiration by the skill with
which they manage their elegant craft, so that Admiral
Lütke recognized them as Cossacks of the Sea.</p>

<p>Oonalaska is the principal of these islands, and from
the time they were first visited seems to have excited
a peculiar interest. Captain Cook painted it kindly;
so have succeeding navigators. And here have lived
the islanders who have given to navigators a new experience.
Alluding especially to them, the reporter of
Billings’s voyage says: “The capacity of the natives of
these islands infinitely surpasses every idea that I had
formed of the abilities of savages.”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> There is another
remark of this authority which shows how they had
yielded, even in their favorite dress, to the demands of
commerce. After saying that formerly they had worn
garments of sea-otter, he pathetically adds, “but not
since the Russians have had any intercourse with
them.”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Poor islanders! Exchanging choice furs, once
their daily wear, for meaner skins!</p>

<p>(3.) The <i>Kenaians</i>, numbering as many as 25,000,
take their common name from the peninsula of Kenai,
with Cook’s Inlet on the west and Prince William
Sound on the east. Numerous beyond any other
family in Russian America, they belong to a widespread
and teeming Indian race, which occupies all the
northern interior of the continent, stretching from Hudson’s
Bay in the east to the Esquimaux in the west.
This is the great nation called sometimes Athabascan,
or, from the native name of the Rocky Mountains, on
whose flanks they live, Chippewyan, but more properly
designated as Tinneh, with branches in Southern Oregon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
and Northern California, and then again with other
offshoots, known as the Apaches and Navajoes, in Arizona,
New Mexico, and Chihuahua, thirty degrees of
latitude from the parent stem. Of this extended race,
the northwestern branch, known to travellers as Loucheux,
and in their own tongue as Kutchin, after occupying
the inner portion of Russian America on the
Yukon and the Porcupine, reached the sea-coast at
Cook’s Inlet, where they appear under the name of
Kenaians. The latter are said to bear about the same
relation, in language and intellectual development, to
the entire group, as the islanders of Kadiak bear to the
Esquimaux.</p>

<p>The Kenaians call themselves in their own dialect by
yet another name, Thnainas, meaning Men; thus, by a
somewhat boastful designation, asserting manhood. Their
features and complexion associate them with the red men
of America, as does their speech. The first to visit them
was Cook, and he was struck by the largeness of their
heads, which seemed to him disproportioned to the rest
of the body. They were strong-chested also, with thick,
short necks, spreading faces, eyes inclined to be small,
white teeth, black hair, and thin beard,&mdash;their persons
clean and decent, without grease or dirt. In dress they
were thought to resemble the people of Greenland. Their
boats had a similar affinity. But in these particulars
they were not unlike the other races already described.
They were clothed in skins of animals, with the fur outward,
or sometimes in skins of birds, over which, for
protection against rain, was a frock made from the intestines
of the whale, “prepared so skilfully as almost to
resemble our gold-beater leaf.”<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Their boats were of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
seal-skin stretched on frames, and of different sizes. In
one of these Cook counted twenty women and one man,
besides children. At that time, though thievish in propensity,
they were not unamiable. Shortly afterwards
they were reported by Russian traders, who had much
to do with them, as “good people,” who behaved “in
the most friendly manner.”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> I do not know that they
have lost this character since.</p>

<p>Here, too, is the accustomed multiplicity of tribes,
each with its idiom, and sometimes differing in religious
superstition, especially on the grave question of descent
from the dog or the crow. There is also a prevailing
usage for the men of one tribe to choose wives from
another tribe, when the tribal character of the mother
attaches to the offspring, which is another illustration
of the Law of Slavery, <i>Partus sequitur ventrem</i>. The
late departure from this usage is quoted by the old
men as a sufficient reason for the mortality which has
afflicted the Kenaians, although a better reason is found
in the ravages of the small-pox, unhappily introduced
by the Russians. In 1838, ten thousand persons on the
coast are reported victims to this disease.</p>

<p>(4.) Last of the four races are the <i>Koloschians</i>, numbering
about 4,000, who occupy the coast and islands
from the mouth of the Copper River to the southern
boundary of Russian America, making about sixteen
settlements. They belong to an Indian group extending
as far south as the Straits of Fuca, and estimated
to contain 25,000 souls. La Pérouse, after considerable
experience of the aborigines on the Atlantic coast, asserts
that those he saw here are not Esquimaux.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
name seems to be of Russian origin, and is equivalent
to Indian. Here again is another variety of language,
and as many separate nations. Near Mount St. Elias
are the Yakutats, who are the least known; then come
the Thlinkits, occupying the islands and coast near Sitka,
and known in Oregon under the name of Stikines;
and then again we have the Kygans, who, beginning
on Russian territory, overlap Queen Charlotte’s Island,
beneath the British flag. All these, with their subdivisions,
are Koloschians; but every tribe or nation has
four different divisions, derived from four different animals,
the whale, the eagle, the crow, and the wolf, which
are so many heraldic devices, marking distinct groups.</p>

<p>Points already noticed in the more northern groups
are repeated here. As among the Kenaians, husband
and wife are of different animal devices. A crow cannot
marry a crow. There is the same skill in the construction
of canoes; but the stretched seal-skin gives
place to the trunk of a tree shaped and hollowed, so that
it sometimes holds forty persons. There are good qualities
among Aleutians which the Koloschians do not
possess; but the latter have, perhaps, stronger sense.
They are of constant courage. As daring navigators
they are unsurpassed, sailing six or seven hundred miles
in open canoes. Some are thrifty, and show a sense of
property. Some have developed an aptitude for trade
unknown to their northern neighbors, or to the Indians
of the United States, and will work for wages, whether
in tilling the ground or other employment. Their superior
nature discards corporal punishment, even for boys,
as an ignominy not to be endured. They believe in a
Creator, and in the immortality of the soul. But here a
mystic fable is woven into their faith. The spirits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
heroes dead in battle are placed in the sky, and appear
in the Aurora Borealis. Long ago a deluge occurred,
when the human family was saved in a floating vessel,
which, after the subsidence of the waters, struck on a
rock and broke in halves. The Koloschians represent
one half of the vessel, and the rest of the world the
other half. Such is that pride of race which civilization
does not always efface.</p>

<p>For generations they have been warriors, prompt to
take offence, and vindictive, as is the nature of the Indian
race,&mdash;always ready to exact an eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth. This character has not changed.
As was the case once in Italy, the dagger is an inseparable
companion. Private quarrels are common. The duel
is an institution. So is slavery still,&mdash;having a triple
origin in war, purchase, or birth. The slave is only a
dog, and must obey his master in all things, even to
taking the life of another. He is without civil rights;
he cannot marry or possess anything; he can eat only
offal; and his body, when released by death, is thrown
into the sea. A chief sometimes sacrifices his slaves,
and then another chief seeks to outdo his inhumanity.
All this is indignantly described by Sir Edward Belcher
and Sir George Simpson. But a slave once a freedman
has all the rights of a Koloschian. Here, too, are
the distinctions of wealth. The rich paint their faces
daily; the poor renew the paint only when the colors
begin to disappear.</p>

<p>These are the same people who for more than a century
have been a terror on this coast. It was Koloschians
who received the two boats’ crews of the Russian discoverer
in 1741, as they landed in one of its wooded
coves, and no survivor returned to tell their fate. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
were actors in another tragedy at the beginning of the
century, when the Russian fort at Sitka was stormed
and its defenders put to death, some with excruciating
torture. Lisiansky, whose visit was shortly afterward,
found them “a shrewd and bold, though a perfidious
people,” whose chiefs used “very sublime expressions,”
and swore oaths, like that of Demosthenes, “by their ancestors,
by relatives living and dead, and called heaven,
earth, the sun, moon, and stars to witness for them, particularly
when they meant to deceive.”<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> According to
D’Wolf, “both sexes are expert in the use of fire-arms,”
and he saw them bathing in the sea with the thermometer
below freezing, running over the ice, and “performing
all manner of antics with the same apparent enjoyment
as if it had been a warm spring.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The fort has
been repeatedly threatened by these warriors, who multiply
by reinforcements from the interior, so that the
governor in 1837 reported, that, “although seven hundred
only were now in the neighborhood, seven thousand
might arrive in a few hours.”<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> A little later their
character was recognized by Sir George Simpson, when
he pronounced them “numerous, treacherous, and fierce,”
in contrast with Aleutians, whom he describes as “peaceful
even to cowardice.”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> And yet this fighting race is
not entirely indocile, if we may credit recent report, that
its warriors are changing to traders.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>3. <i>Climate.</i>&mdash;From Population I pass to Climate,
which is more important, as it is a constant force.
Climate is the key to this whole region. It is the
governing power which rules production and life, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Nature and man must each conform to its laws. Here
at last the observations of science give to inquiry a solid
support.</p>

<p>Montesquieu has some famous chapters on the influence
of climate over customs and institutions.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Conclusions
regarded in his day as visionary or far-fetched
are now unquestioned truth. Climate is a universal
master. But nowhere, perhaps, does it appear more eccentric
than in the southern portion of Russian America.
Without a knowledge of climatic laws, the weather
here would seem like a freak of Nature. But a brief
explanation shows how all its peculiarities are the result
of natural causes which operate with a force as unerring
as gravitation. Heat and cold, rain and fog, to
say nothing of snow and ice, which play such a part,
are not abnormal, but according to law.</p>

<p>This law has been known only of late years. Even so
ingenious an inquirer as Captain Cook notices the mildness
of the climate, without attempting to account for it.
He records, that, in his opinion, “cattle might subsist in
Oonalaska all the year round without being housed”;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
and this was in latitude 53° 52´, on the same parallel
with Labrador, and several degrees north of Quebec;
but he stops with a simple statement of the suggestive
fact. This, however, was inconsistent with the received
idea at the time. A geographer, who wrote a few
years before Cook sailed, has a chapter in which, assuming
that the climate of Quebec continues across the
continent, he argues that America is colder than Asia.
I refer to the “Mémoires Géographiques” of Engel.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
He would have been astonished, had he seen the revelations
of an isothermal map, showing precisely the
reverse: that the climate of Quebec does not continue
across the continent; that the Pacific coast of our continent
is warmer than the corresponding Atlantic coast;
and that America is warmer than Asia, so far at least
as can be determined by the two opposite coasts. Such
is the truth, of which there are plentiful signs. The
Flora on the American side, even in Behring Strait, is
more vigorous than that on the Asiatic side, and the
American mountains have less snow in summer than
their Asiatic neighbors. Among many illustrations of
the temperature, I know none more direct than that
furnished by the late Hon. William Sturgis, of Boston,&mdash;who
was familiar with the Northwest Coast at
the beginning of the century,&mdash;in a lecture on the Oregon
question in 1845. After remarking that the climate
there is “altogether milder and the winter less
severe than in corresponding latitudes on this side the
continent,” he proceeds to testify, that, as a proof of its
mildness, he had “passed seven winters between the
latitudes of 51° and 57°, frequently lying so near the
shore as to have a small cable fast to the trees upon
it, and only once was his ship surrounded by ice sufficiently
firm to bear the weight of a man.”<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> But this
intelligent navigator assigns no reason. To the common
observer it seemed as if the temperature grew milder,
travelling with the sun until it dipped in the ocean.</p>

<p>Among authorities open before me I quote two, which
show that this difference of temperature between the
Atlantic and Pacific coasts was imagined, if not actually
recognized, during the last century. Portlock, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Englishman, who was on the coast in 1786, after saying
that during stormy and unsettled weather the air had
been mild and temperate, remarks that he is “inclined
to think that the climate here is not so severe as has
been generally supposed.”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> La Pérouse, the Frenchman,
whose visit was the same year, having been before
in Hudson’s Bay, on the other side of the continent,
says still more explicitly, “The climate of this
coast seemed to me infinitely milder than that of Hudson’s
Bay, in the same latitude. We measured pines
six feet in diameter and a hundred and forty feet high;
those of the same species at Fort Prince of Wales and
Fort York are of a dimension scarcely sufficient for
studding-sail booms.”<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Langsdorff, when at Sitka in
1805-6, was much with D’Wolf, the American navigator,
and records the surprise of the latter “at finding
the cold less severe in Norfolk Sound than at Boston,
Rhode Island, and other provinces of the United
States, which lie more to the south.”<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> D’Wolf, in his
own work, says: “January brought cold, but not severe
weather”; and in February, the weather, though
“rather more severe than the previous month,” was
“by no means so cold as in the United States, latitude
42°.”<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>All this is now explained by known forces in Nature.
Of these the most important is a thermal current
in the Pacific, corresponding to the Gulf Stream
in the Atlantic. The latter, having its origin in the
heated waters of the Gulf of Mexico, flows as a river
through the ocean northward, encircling England, bathing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Norway, and warming all within its influence. A
similar stream in the Pacific, sometimes called the Japanese
Current, having its origin under the equator near
the Philippines and the Moluccas, amid no common
heats, after washing the ancient empire of Japan, sweeps
north, until, forming two branches, one moves onward
to Behring Strait, and the other bends east, along the
Aleutian Islands, and then south, along the coast of Sitka,
Oregon, and California. Geographers have described
this “heater,” which in the lower latitudes is as high
as 81° of Fahrenheit, and even far to the north as high
as 50°. A chart in Findlay’s “Pacific Ocean Directory”
portrays its course, as it warms so many islands and
such an extent of coast. An officer of the United States
Navy, Lieutenant Bent, in a paper before the Geographical
Society of New York, while exhibiting the influence
of this current in mitigating the climate of the
Northwest Coast, mentions that vessels on the Asiatic
side, becoming unwieldy with accumulations of ice on
the hull and rigging, run over to the higher latitude
on the American side and “thaw out.” But the tepid
waters which melt the ice on a vessel must change the
atmosphere, wherever they flow.</p>

<p>I hope you will not regard the illustration as too
familiar, if I remind you that in the economy of a
household pipes of hot water are sometimes employed
in tempering the atmosphere by heat carried from below
to rooms above. In the economy of Nature these
thermal currents are only pipes of hot water, modifying
the climate of continents by carrying heat from
the warm cisterns of the South into the most distant
places of the North. So also there are sometimes pipes
of hot air, having a similar purpose; and these, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
are found in this region. Every ocean wind, from every
quarter, traversing the stream of heat, takes up the
warmth and carries it to the coast, so that the oceanic
current is reinforced by an aërial current of constant
influence.</p>

<p>These forces are aided essentially by the configuration
of the Northwest Coast, with a lofty and impenetrable
barricade of mountains, by which its islands
and harbors are protected from the cold of the North.
Occupying the Aleutian Islands, traversing the peninsula
of Alaska, and running along the margin of the
ocean to the latitude of 54° 40´, this mountain-ridge is
a climatic division, or, according to a German geographer,
a “climatic shed,” such as perhaps exists nowhere
else in the world. Here are Alps, some of them
volcanic, with Mount St. Elias higher than Mont Blanc,
standing guard against the Arctic Circle. So it seems
even without the aid of science. Here is a dike between
the icy waters of Behring Sea and the milder
Southern Ocean. Here is a partition between the treeless
northern coast and the wooded shores of the Kenaians
and Koloschians. Here is a fence which separates
the animal kingdom, having on one side the walrus
and ice-fox from the Frozen Ocean, and on the other
side the humming-bird from the tropics. I simply report
the testimony of geography. And now you will
not fail to observe how by this configuration the thermal
currents of ocean and air are left to exercise their
climatic power.</p>

<p>One other climatic incident here is now easily explained.
Early navigators record the prevailing moisture.
All are enveloped in fog. Behring names an
island Foggy. Another gives the same designation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
a cape at the southern extremity of Russian America.
Cook records fog. La Pérouse speaks of rain and continued
fog in the month of August. And now visitors,
whether for science or business, make the same report.
The forests testify also. According to physical geography,
it could not be otherwise. The warm air from
the ocean, encountering the snow-capped mountains,
would naturally produce this result. Rain is nothing
but atmosphere condensed and falling in drops to the
earth. Fog is atmosphere held in solution, but so far
condensed as to become visible. This condensation occurs,
when the air is chilled by contact with a colder
atmosphere. These very conditions occur on the Northwest
Coast. The ocean air, coming in contact with the
elevated range, is chilled, until its moisture is set free.</p>

<p>Add to these influences, especially at Sitka, the presence
of mountain masses and of dense forests, all tending
to make the coast warmer in winter and colder in
summer than it would otherwise be.</p>

<p>Practical observation verifies these conclusions of science.
Any isothermal map is enough for our purpose;
but there are others which show the relative conditions
generally of different portions of the globe. I ask attention
to those of Keith Johnston, in his admirable
Atlas. But I am glad to present a climatic table of
the Pacific coast in comparison with the Atlantic coast,
recently compiled, at my request, from the archives of
the Smithsonian Institution, with permission of its
learned secretary, by a collaborator of the Institution,
who visited Russian America under the auspices of the
Telegraph Company. By this table we are able to comprehend
the relative position of this region in the physical
geography of the world.</p>

<p>It is seen here that the winters of Sitka are relatively
warm, not differing much from those of Washington;
but the summers are colder. The mean temperature
of winter is 32.30°, while that of summer is
53.37°. The Washington winter is 33.57°; the Washington
summer is 73.07°. These points exhibit the peculiarities
of this coast,&mdash;warm winters and cool summers.</p>

<p>The winter of Sitka is milder than that of many
European capitals. It is much milder than that of St.
Petersburg, Moscow, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Berlin, or
Bern. It is milder even than that of Mannheim, Stuttgart,
Vienna, Sebastopol in the Crimea, or Turin. It
is not much colder than that of Padua. According to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
observations at Sitka in 1831, it froze only two days
in December and seven days in January. In February,
the longest frost lasted five days; in March, it did not
freeze during the day at all, and rarely in the night.
During the next winter, the thermometer did not fall
below 21° Fahrenheit; in January, 1834, it reached 11°.
On the other hand, a temperature of 50° has been noted
in January. The roadstead is open throughout the year,
and only a few landlocked bays are frozen.</p>

<p>The prevailing dampness at Sitka renders a residence
there far from agreeable, although it does not appear injurious
to health. England is also damp; but Englishmen
boast that theirs is the best climate of the world.
At Sitka the annual fall of rain is about ninety inches.
The mean annual fall in all England is forty inches,
although in mountainous districts of Cumberland and
Westmoreland the fall amounts to ninety and even one
hundred and forty inches. In Washington it is forty-one
inches. The forests at Sitka are so wet that they
will not burn, although frequent attempts have been
made to set them on fire. The houses, which are of
wood, suffer from constant moisture. In 1828 there
were twenty days when it rained or snowed continuously;
one hundred and twenty when it rained or
snowed part of the day, and only sixty-six days of
clear weather. Some years, only forty bright days have
been counted. Hinds, the naturalist, records only thirty-seven
“really clear and fine days.”<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> A scientific observer
who was there last year counted sixty. A visitor
for fourteen days found only two when nautical
observations could be made; but these were as fine as
he had ever known in any country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole coast from Sitka to the peninsula of
Alaska seems to have the same continuous climate,
whether in temperature or moisture. The island of
Kadiak and the recess of Cook’s Inlet are outside this
climatic curve, so as to be comparatively dry. Langsdorff
reports winters “frequently so mild in the low
parts of Kadiak that the snow does not lie upon the
ground for any length of time, nor is anything like
severe cold felt.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Belcher, on his passage between
Montague and Hinchinbrook Islands, found an “oppressively
hot sun.”<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The Aleutian Islands, further
west, are somewhat colder than Sitka, although the
difference is not great. The summer temperature is seldom
above 66°; the winter temperature is more seldom
as low as 2° below zero. The snow falls about the beginning
of October, and is seen sometimes as late as
the end of April; but it does not remain long on the
surface. The mean temperature of Oonalaska is about
40°. Chamisso found the temperature of spring-water
at the beginning of the year 38.50°. There are years
when it rains on this island the whole winter. The
fogs prevail from April till the middle of July, when
for the time they are driven further north. The islands
northward toward Behring Strait are proportionately
colder; but I remind you that the American coast is
milder than the opposite coast of Asia.</p>

<p>From Mr. Bannister I have an authentic statement
with regard to the temperature north of the Aleutians,
as observed by himself in the autumn of 1865 and the
months following. Even here the winter does not seem
so terrible as is sometimes imagined. During most of
the time, work could be done with comfort in the open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
air. Only when it stormed the men were kept within
doors. In transporting supplies from St. Michael’s to
Nulato, a distance of two hundred and fifty miles, they
found no hardship, even when obliged to bivouac in the
open air.</p>

<p>On Norton Sound and the Kwichpak River winter
may be said to commence at the end of September, although
the weather is not severe till the end of October.
The first snow falls about the 20th or 25th of September.
All the small ponds and lakes were frozen
early in October. The Kwichpak was frozen solid about
the 20th or 25th of this month. On the 1st of November
the harbor at St. Michael’s was still open, but on
the morning of the 4th it was frozen solid enough for
sledges to cross on the ice. In December there were
two thaws, one accompanied by rain for a day. The
snow was about two feet deep at the end of the month.
January was uniformly cold, and it was said that at a
place sixty-five miles northeast of St. Michael’s the thermometer
descended to 58° below zero. February was
usually mild all over the country. In the middle of the
month there was an extensive thaw, with showers of
rain. About half the snow disappeared, leaving much of
the ground bare. March was pleasant, without very cold
weather. Its mean temperature was 20°; its minimum
was 3° below zero. Spring commences on the Kwichpak
the 1st of May, or a few days later, when the birds
return and vegetation begins. The ice did not entirely
disappear from the river till after the 20th of May. The
sea-ice continued in the bay of St. Michael’s as late as
1st June. The summer temperature is much higher in
the interior than on the coast. Parties travelling on the
Kwichpak in June complained sometimes of heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>The river Yukon, which, flowing into the Kwichpak,
helps to swell that stream, is navigable for at least
four, if not five, months in the year. The thermometer
at Fort Yukon is sometimes at 65° below zero of
Fahrenheit, and for three months of a recent winter it
stood at 50° below zero without variation. In summer
it rises above 80° in the shade; but a hard frost
occurs at times in August. The southwest wind brings
warmth; the northeast wind brings cold. Some years,
there is no rain for months; and then, again, showers
alternate with sunshine. The snow packs hard at an
average of two and a half feet deep. The ice is four
or five feet thick; in a severe winter it is six feet thick.
Life at Fort Yukon, under these rigors of Nature, although
far from inviting, is not intolerable.</p>

<p>Such is the climate of this extensive region, so far
as known, along its coast, among its islands, and on its
great rivers, from its southern limit to its most northern
ice, with contrasts and varieties such as Milton describes:&mdash;</p>

<p>4. <i>Vegetable Products.</i>&mdash;Vegetable products depend
upon climate. They are determined by its laws. Therefore
what has been already said upon the one prepares
the way for the consideration of the other; and here
we have the reports of navigators and the suggestions
of science.</p>

<p>From the time this coast was first visited, navigators
reported the aspects which Nature assumed. But their
opportunities were casual, and they necessarily confined
themselves to what was most obvious. As civilization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
did not exist, the only vegetable products were indigenous
to the soil. At the first landing, on the discovery
of the coast by Behring, Steller found among the
provisions in one of the Indian cabins “a sweet herb
dressed for food in the same manner as in Kamtchatka.”
That “sweet herb” is the first vegetable production
of which we have record on this coast. At the same
time, although ashore only six hours, this naturalist
“gathered herbs, and brought such a quantity to the
ship that the describing of them took him a considerable
time.” This description was afterwards adopted
by Gmelin in his “Flora Sibirica.”<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Trees were noticed even before landing. They enter
into descriptions, and are often introduced to increase
the savage wildness of the scene. La Pérouse doubts
“if the deep valleys of the Alps and the Pyrenees present
a scene so frightful, but at the same time so picturesque
that it would deserve to be visited by the curious,
if it were not at one of the extremities of the
earth.”<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Lisiansky, as he approached the coast of Sitka,
records that “nothing presented itself to the view but
impenetrable woods, reaching from the water-side to the
very tops of the highest mountains”; that he “never
saw a country so wild and gloomy; it appeared more
adapted for the residence of wild beasts than of men.”<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
Lütke portrays the “savage and picturesque aspect”
of the whole Northwest Coast.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>As navigators landed, they saw Nature in detail; and
here they were impressed by the size of the trees. Cook
finds at Prince William Sound “Canadian and spruce
pine, and some of them tolerably large.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> La Pérouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
describes pines measuring six feet in diameter and one
hundred and forty feet in height, and then again introduces
us to “those superb pines fit for the masts of
our largest vessels.”<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Portlock notices in Cook’s Inlet
“wood of different kinds in great abundance, such as
pine, black-birch, witch-hazel, and poplar; many of the
pines large enough for lower masts for a ship of four
hundred tons burden”; and then again at Prince William
Sound “trees of the pine kind, some very large; a
good quantity of alder; a kind of hazel, but not larger
than will do for making handspikes.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Meares reports
“woods thick,” also “the black-pine in great plenty,
capable of making excellent spars.”<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Sauer, who was
there a little later, in the expedition of Billings, reports
that they “took in a number of fine spars”; and
he proceeds to say: “The timber comprised a variety
of pines of an immense thickness and height, some
extremely tough and fibrous, and of these we made
our best oars.”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Vancouver mentions, in latitude 60°, a
“woodland country.”<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Langsdorff describes trees in the
neighborhood of Sitka, many of them measuring six feet
in diameter and one hundred and fifty feet in height,
“excellent wood for ship-building and masts.”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Lisiansky
says, that, at Kadiak, “for want of fir, we made
a new bowsprit of one of the pine-trees, which answered

fine-grained, bright yellow cypress” as the most valuable
wood, which, besides being used in boats, was exported
to the Sandwich Islands, in return especially for
Chinese goods.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Turning westward from Cook’s Inlet, the forests on
the sea-line are rarer, until they entirely disappear. The
first settlement on the island of Kadiak was on the
southwestern coast; but the want of timber caused its
transfer to the northeastern coast, where are “considerable
forests of fine tall trees.”<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> But where trees are
wanting, grass seems to abound. This is the case with
Kadiak, the peninsula of Alaska, and the Aleutian
Islands generally. Of these, Oonalaska, libelled in
the immortal verse of Campbell, has been the most
described. This well-known island is without trees;
but it seems singularly adapted to the growth of grass,
which is often so high as to impede the traveller and
to overtop even the willows. The mountains themselves
are for a considerable distance clothed with rich
turf. One of these scenes is represented in a print
you will find among the views of the vegetation of
the Pacific in the London reproduction of the work
of Kittlitz. This peculiarity was first noticed by Cook,
who says, with a sailor’s sententiousness, that he did
not see there “a single stick of wood of any size,”
but “plenty of grass, which grows very thick and to
a great length.”<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Lütke records, that, after leaving
Brazil, he met nothing so agreeable as the grass of
this island.</p>

<p>North of the peninsula of Alaska, on Behring Sea,
the forests do not approach the coast, except at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
heads of bays and sounds, although they abound in the
interior, and extend even to within a short distance
of the Frozen Ocean. Such is the personal testimony
of a scientific observer recently returned from this region.
In Norton Sound, Cook, who was the first to
visit it, reports “a coast covered with wood, an agreeable
sight,” and, on walking into the country, small
spruce-trees, “none of them above six or eight inches
in diameter.” A few days afterward “a party of men
were sent on shore to cut brooms, and the branches of
spruce-trees for brewing beer.”<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> On the Kwichpak,
and its affluent, the Yukon, trees are sometimes as
high as a hundred feet. The supply of timber at St.
Michael’s is from the drift-wood of the river. Near
Fort Yukon, at the junction of the Porcupine and Yukon,
are forests of pine, poplar, willow, and birch. The
pine is the most plentiful; but the small islands in
the great river are covered with poplar and willow.
Immense trunks rolling under the fort show that there
must be large trees nearer the head-waters.</p>

<p>But even in northern latitudes the American coast is
not without vegetation. Grass takes the place of trees.
At Fort Yukon, in latitude 67°, there is “a thin, wiry
grass.” Navigators notice the contrast between the opposite
coasts of the two continents. Kotzebue, while in
Behring Strait, where the two approach each other, was
struck by black, mossy rocks frowning with snow and
icicles on the Asiatic side, while on the American side
“even the summits of the highest mountains were free
from snow,” and “the coast was covered with a green
carpet.”<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> But the contrast with the Atlantic coast of
the continent is hardly less. The northern limit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
trees is full seven degrees higher in Russian America
than in Labrador. In point of fact, on the Atlantic
coast, in latitude 57° 58´, which is nearly that of Sitka,
there are no trees. All this is most suggestive.</p>

<p>Next after trees, early navigators speak oftenest of
berries, which they found in profusion. Not a sailor
lands who does not find them. Cook reports “a variety
of berries” at Norton Sound, and “great quantities”
at Oonalaska.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Portlock finds at Prince William
Sound “fruit-bushes in great abundance, such as bilberry-bushes,
raspberry-bushes, strawberries, elder-berry-bushes,
and currant-bushes, red and black,” and “any
quantity of the berries might be gathered for a winter’s
stock.”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Meares saw there “a few black-currant-bushes.”<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
Billings finds at Kadiak “several species of
berries, with currants and raspberries in abundance, the
latter white, but extremely large, being bigger than any
mulberry he had ever seen.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Langsdorff notes most of
these at Oonalaska, with cranberries and whortleberries
besides.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Belcher reports at Garden Island “strawberries,
whortleberries, blaeberries, pigeon-berries, and
a small cranberry, in tolerable profusion, without going
in search of them.”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> These I quote precisely, and in
the order of time.</p>

<p>Next to berries were plants for food; and these were
in constant abundance. Behring, on landing at the
Shumagin Islands, observed the natives “to eat roots
which they dug out of the ground, and scarce shaked
off the earth before they eat them.”<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Cook reports at
Oonalaska “a great variety of plants, several of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
such as we find in Europe and in other parts of America,
particularly in Newfoundland: … all these we
found very palatable, dressed either in soups or in salads.”<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
La Pérouse, who landed in latitude 58° 37´, finds
a French bill of fare, including celery, chicory, sorrel, and
“almost all the pot-herbs of the meadows and mountains
of France,” besides “several kinds of grass suitable
for forage.” Every day and each meal the ship’s
kettle was filled with these supplies, and all ate them
in soups, ragouts, and salads, much to the benefit of
their health.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Portlock mentions at Port Etches, besides
“fine water-cresses,” “just above the beach, between
the bay and the lake, a piece of wild wheat,
about two hundred yards long and five yards wide,
growing at least two feet high,” which, “with proper
care, might certainly be made an useful article of food”;
and at Cook’s Inlet he reports “ginseng and snakeroot.”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
Meares reports at the latter place “inexhaustible
plenty” of ginseng, and at Prince William Sound
“snakeroot and ginseng, some of which the natives have
always with them as a medicine.” He adds: “The ginseng
of this part of America is far preferable to that of
the eastern side.”<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Billings finds at Kadiak “ginseng,
wild onions, and the edible roots of Kamtchatka,” and
then again at Prince William Sound “plenty of ginseng
and some snakeroot.”<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Vancouver finds at Port Mulgrave
“wild vegetables in great abundance.”<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Langsdorff
adds to the list, at Oonalaska, “that sweet plant,
the Siberian parsnip.”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> These, too, I quote precisely,
and in the order of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the establishment of Europeans on this coast,
an attempt has been made to introduce the nutritious
grains and vegetables known to the civilized world, but
without very brilliant success. Against wheat and rye
and against orchard fruits are obstacles of climate, perhaps
insuperable. These require summer heat; but here
the summer is comparatively cold. The northern limit
of wheat is several degrees below the southern limit of
these possessions, so that this friendly grain is out of
the question. Rye flourishes further north, as do oats
also. The supposed northern boundary of these grains
embraces Sitka and grazes the Aleutian Islands. But
other climatic conditions are wanting, at least for rye.
One of these is dry weather, which is required at the
time of its bloom. Possibly the clearing of the forest
may produce a modification of the weather. At present
barley grows better, and there is reason to believe
that it may be cultivated successfully very far to the
north. It has ripened at Kadiak. Many garden vegetables
have become domesticated. Lütke reports potatoes
at Sitka, so that all have enough.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Langsdorff reports
the same of Kadiak and Oonalaska.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> There are
also at Sitka radishes, cabbages, cauliflowers, peas, and
carrots,&mdash;making a very respectable list. At Norton
Sound I hear of radishes, beets, and cabbages. Even
as far north as Fort Yukon, on the parallel of 67°, potatoes,
peas, turnips, and even barley, have been grown;
but the turnips were unfit for the table, being rotten at
the heart. A recent resident reports that there are no
fruit-trees, and not even a raspberry-bush, and that he
lost all his potatoes during one season by a frost in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
latter days of July; but do not forget that these potatoes
were the wall-flowers of the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that the vegetable productions of
the country are represented practically by trees. The
forests, overshadowing the coast from Sitka to Cook’s
Inlet, are all that can be shown under this head out of
which a revenue can be derived, unless we add ginseng,
so much prized by the Chinese, and perhaps also
snakeroot. Other things may contribute to the scanty
support of a household; but timber will, in all probability,
be an article of commerce. It has been so already.
Ships from the Sandwich Islands have come
for it, and there is reason to believe that this trade
may be extended indefinitely, so that Russian America
will be on the Pacific like Maine on the Atlantic, and
the lumbermen of Sitka vie with their hardy brethren
of the East.</p>

<p>These forests, as described, seem to afford all that can
be desired. The trees are abundant, and they are perfect
in size, not unlike</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent8">“the tallest pine</div>
<div class="verse">Hewn on Norwegian hills to be the mast</div>
<div class="verse">Of some great ammiral.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But a doubt has been raised as to their commercial
value. Here we have the inconsistent testimony of
Lütke. According to him, the pines and firs, which
he calls “magnificent,” constitute an untried source of
commercial wealth. Not only California, but other
countries, poor in trees, like Mexico, the Sandwich
Islands, and even Chili, will need them. And yet he
does not conceal an unfavorable judgment of the timber,
which, as seen in the houses of Sitka, suffering
from constant moisture, did not seem durable.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Edward Belcher differs from the Russian admiral, for
he praises especially “the timber of the higher latitudes,
either for spars or plank.”<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Perhaps its durability
may depend upon the climate where it is used;
so that, though failing amidst the damps of Sitka, it
may be lasting enough, when transported to another climate.
In the rarity of trees on the islands and main-land
of the Pacific, the natural supply is in Russian
America. One of the early navigators even imagined
that China must look this way, and he expected that
“the woods would yield a handsome revenue, when the
Russian commerce with China should be established.”<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
American commerce with China is established. Perhaps
timber may become one of its staples.</p>

<p>A profitable commerce in timber has already begun
at Puget Sound. By official returns of 1866 it appears
that it was exported to a long list of foreign countries
and places, in which I find Victoria, Honolulu, Callao,
Tahiti, Canton, Valparaiso, Adelaide, Hong Kong, Sydney,
Montevideo, London, Melbourne, Shanghae, Peru,
Coquimbo, Calcutta, Hilo, Cape Town, Cork, Guaymas,
and Siam; and in this commerce were employed no
less than eighteen ships, thirty barks, four brigs, twenty-eight
schooners, and ten steamers. The value of the
lumber and spars exported abroad was over half a million
dollars, while more than four times that amount
was shipped coastwise. But the coasts of Russian
America are darker with trees than those further south.
Pines, in which they abound, do not flourish as low
down as Puget Sound. Northward, they are numerous
and easily accessible.</p>

<p>In our day the Flora of the coast has been explored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
with care. Kittlitz, who saw it as a naturalist, portrays
it with the enthusiasm of an early navigator; but he
speaks with knowledge. He, too, dwells on the “surprising
power and luxuriance” of the pine forests, describing
them with critical skill. The trees which he
identifies are the Pinus Canadensis, distinguished for
its delicate foliage; the Pinus Mertensiana, a new species,
rival of the other in height; and the Pinus Palustris,
growing on swampy declivities, and not attaining
height. In the clearings or on the outskirts of
thickets are shrubs, being chiefly a species of Rubus,
with flowers of carmine and aromatic fruit. About and
over all are mosses and lichens, invigorated by the constant
moisture, while colossal trees, undermined or uprooted,
crowd the surface, reminding the scientific observer
of the accumulations of the coal measures. Two
different prints in the London reproduction of the work
of Kittlitz present pictures of these vegetable productions
grouped for beauty and instruction. I refer to
these, and also to the Essay of Hinds on “The Regions
of Vegetation,” the latter to be found at the end of the
volumes containing Belcher’s Voyage.</p>

<p>In turning from the vegetable products of this region,
it will not be out of place, if I refer for one moment
to its domestic animals, for these are necessarily
associated with such products. Some time ago it was
stated that cattle had not flourished at Sitka, owing
to the want of proper pasturage, and the difficulty of
making hay in a climate of such moisture. Hogs are
more easily sustained, but, feeding on fish, instead of
vegetable products, their flesh acquires a fishy taste,
which does not recommend it. Nor has there been
great success with poultry, for this becomes the prey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of the crow, whose voracity here is absolutely fabulous.
A Koloschian tribe traces its origin to this bird, which
in this neighborhood might be a fit progenitor. Not
content with swooping upon hens and chickens, it descends
upon swine to nibble at their tails, and so successfully
“that the hogs here are without tails,” and
then it scours the streets so well that it is called the
Scavenger of Sitka. But there are other places more
favored. The grass at Kadiak is well suited to cattle,
and it is supposed that sheep would thrive there.
The grass at Oonalaska is famous, and Cook thought
the climate good for cattle, of which we have at least
one illustration. Langsdorff reports that a cow grazed
here luxuriously for several years, and then was lost
in the mountains. That grazing animal is a good witness.
Perhaps also it is typical of the peaceful inhabitants.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>5. <i>Mineral Products.</i>&mdash;In considering the Mineral
Products, I ask attention first to the indications afforded
by the early navigators. They were not geologists.
They saw only what was exposed. And yet, during the
long interval that elapsed, not very much has been
added to their conclusions. The existence of iron is
hardly less uncertain now than then. The existence of
copper is hardly more certain now than then. Gold,
which is so often a dangerous <i>ignis-fatuus</i>, did not appear
to deceive them. But coal, which is much more
desirable than gold, was reported by several, and once
at least with reasonable certainty.</p>

<p>The boat that landed from Behring, when he discovered
the coast, found among other things “a whetstone
on which it appeared that copper knives had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
been sharpened.” This was the first sign of the mineral
wealth which already excites such interest. At another
point where Behring landed, “one of the Americans had
a knife hanging by his side, of which his people took
particular notice on account of its unusual make.”<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> It
has been supposed that this was of iron. Next came
Cook, who, when in Prince William Sound, saw “copper
and iron.” In his judgment, the iron came, “through
the intervention of the more inland tribes, from Hudson’s
Bay, or the settlements on the Canadian lakes,”
and his editor refers in a note to the knife seen by
Behring as from the same quarter; but Cook thought
that the copper was obtained near at home, as the natives,
when engaged in barter, gave the idea, “that, having
so much of this metal of their own, they wanted
no more.”<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Naturally enough, for they were not far
from the Copper River. Maurelle, in 1779, landed in
sight of Mount St. Elias, and he reports Indians with
arrow-heads of copper, which “made the Spaniards
suspect mines of this metal there.”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> La Pérouse, who
was also in this neighborhood, after mentioning that
the naturalists of the expedition allowed no stone or
pebble to escape observation, reports ochre, copper pyrites,
garnets, schorl, granite, schist, horn-stone, very
pure quartz, mica, plumbago, coal, and then adds that
some of these substances announce that the mountains
conceal mines of iron and copper. He reports further
that the natives had daggers of iron, and sometimes
of red copper; that the latter metal was common
enough, serving for ornaments and for the points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
of arrows; and he then states the very question of
Cook with regard to the acquisition of these metals.
He insists also that “the natives know how to forge
iron and work copper.”<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Spears and arrows “pointed
with bone or iron,” and also “an iron dagger” for
each man, appear in Vancouver’s account of the natives
on the parallel of 55°, just within the southern
limit of Russian America.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Lisiansky saw at Sitka “a
thin plate made of virgin copper” found on Copper
River, three feet in length, and at one end twenty-two
inches in breadth, with various figures painted on
one side, which had come from the possession of the
natives.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Meares reports “pure malleable lumps of copper
ore in the possession of the natives,”&mdash;one piece
weighing as much as a pound, said to have been obtained
in barter with other natives further north,&mdash;also
necklaces and bracelets “of the purest ore.”<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Portlock,
while in Cook’s Inlet, in latitude 59° 27´, at a
place called Graham’s Harbor, makes another discovery.
Walking round the bay, he saw “two veins of kennel
coal situated near some hills just above the beach,
and with very little trouble several pieces were got out
of the bank nearly as large as a man’s head.” If the
good captain did not report more than he saw, this
would be most important; for, from the time when the
amusing biographer of Lord Keeper North described
that clean flaky coal which he calls “candle,” because
often used for its light, but which is generally called
“cannel,” no coal has been more of a household favorite.
He relates, further, that, returning on board in the
evening, he “tried some of the coal, and found it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
burn clear and well.”<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Add to these different accounts
the general testimony of Meares, who, when dwelling
on the resources of the country, boldly includes “mines
which are known to lie between the latitudes of 40°
and 60° north, and which may hereafter prove a most
valuable source of commerce between America and
China.”<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>It is especially when seeking to estimate the mineral
products that we feel the want of careful explorations.
We know more of the roving aborigines than
of these stationary tenants of the soil. We know more
of the trees. A tree is conspicuous; a mineral is hidden
in the earth, to be found by chance or science.
Thus far it seems as if chance only had ruled. The
Russian Government handed over the country to a
trading company, whose exclusive interest was furs.
The company followed its business, when it looked to
wild beasts with rich skins rather than to the soil. Its
mines were above ground, and not below. There were
also essential difficulties in the way of exploration.
The interior was practically inaccessible. The thick
forest, saturated with rain and overgrown with wet
mosses, presented obstacles which nothing but enlightened
enterprise could overcome. Even at a short distance
from the port of Sitka all effort failed, and the
inner recesses of the island, only thirty miles broad,
were never penetrated.</p>

<p>The late Professor Henry D. Rogers, in his admirable
paper on the Physical Features of America, being
part of his contribution to Keith Johnston’s Atlas, full
of knowledge and of fine generalization, says of this
northwest belt, that it is “little known in its topography<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
to any but the roving Indians and the thinly
scattered fur-trappers.” But there are certain general
features which he proceeds to designate. According to
him, it belongs to what is known as the tertiary period
of geology, intervening between the cretaceous period
and that now in progress, but including also granite,
gneiss, and ancient metamorphic rocks. It is not known
if the true coal measures prevail in any part, although
there is reason to believe that they exist on the coast
of the Arctic Ocean between Cape Lisburne and Point
Barrow.</p>

<p>Beginning at the south, we have Sitka and its associate
islands, composed chiefly of volcanic rocks, with
limestone near. Little is known even of the coast between
Sitka and Mount St. Elias, which, itself a volcano,
is the beginning of a volcanic region occupying
the peninsula of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, and
having no less than thirty volcanoes, some extinct, but
others still active. Most of the rocks here are volcanic,
and the only fossiliferous beds are of the tertiary period.
North of Alaska, and near the mouth of the Kwichpak,
the coast seems volcanic or metamorphic, and probably
tertiary, with a vein of lignite near the head of Norton
Sound. At the head of Kotzebue Sound the cliffs
abound in the bones of elephants and mammals now
extinct, together with those of the musk-ox and other
animals still living in the same latitude. From Kotzebue
Sound northward, the coast has a volcanic character.
Then at Cape Thompson it is called subcarboniferous,
followed by rocks of the carboniferous age,
being limestones, shales, and sandstones, which extend
from Cape Lisburne far round to Point Barrow. At
Cape Beaufort, very near the seventieth parallel of latitude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
and north of the Arctic Circle, on a high ridge
a quarter of a mile from the beach is a seam of coal
which appears to be of the true coal measures.</p>

<p>From this general outline, which leaves much in uncertainty,
I come to what is more important.</p>

<p>It is not entirely certain that iron has been found,
although frequently reported. Evidence points to the
south, and also to the north. Near Sitka it was reported
by the Russian engineer Doroschin, although it
does not appear that anything has been done to verify
his report. A visitor there, as late as last year, saw excellent
iron, said to be from a bed in the neighborhood,
reported inexhaustible, and with abundant wood for its
reduction. Then again on Kotzebue Sound specimens
have been collected. At 66° 13´ Kotzebue found a false
result in his calculations, which he attributes to the disturbing
influence of “iron.”<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> A resident on the Yukon
thinks that there is iron in that neighborhood.</p>

<p>Silver, also, has been reported at Sitka by the same
Russian engineer who reported iron, and, like the iron,
in “sufficient quantity to pay for the working.”</p>

<p>Lead was reported by the Russian explorer, Lieutenant
Zagoyskin, on the lower part of the Kwichpak;
but it is not known to what extent it exists.</p>

<p>Copper is found on the banks of the Copper River,
called by the Russians the Mjednaja, meaning copper,
and of its affluent, the Tchetchitno, in masses sometimes
as large as forty pounds. Of this there can be little
doubt. It is mentioned by Golowin, in the “Archiv”
of Erman, as late as 1863. Undoubtedly from this neighborhood
was obtained the copper which arrested the attention
of the early navigators. Traces of copper are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
found in other places on the coast; also in the mountains
near the Yukon, where the Indians use it for
arrow-heads.</p>

<p>Coal seems to exist all along the coast,&mdash;according
to Golowin, “everywhere, in greater or less quantity.”
Traces are reported on the islands of the Sitkan archipelago;
and this is extremely probable, for it has been
worked successfully on Vancouver’s Island below. It is
also found on the Kenaian peninsula, Alaska, the island
of Unga, belonging to the Shumagin group, Oonalaska,
and far to the north at Cape Beaufort. At this last
place it is “slaty, burning with a pure flame and rapid
consumption,” and it is supposed that there are extensive
beds in the neighborhood better in quality. For
an account of this coal I refer to the scientific illustrations
of Beechey’s Voyage. The natives also report coal
in the interior on the Kwichpak. The coal of Oonalaska,
and probably of Alaska, is tertiary, and not adapted
for steamers. With regard to that of Unga scientific
authorities are divided. That of the Kenaian peninsula
is the best and the most extensive. It is found
on the eastern side of Cook’s Inlet, half way between
Cape Anchor and the Russian settlement of St. Nicholas,
in veins three quarters of a yard or more in thickness,
and ranging in quality from mere carboniferous
wood to anthracite. According to one authority, these
coal veins extend and spread far into the interior.
This coal has more than once been sent to California
for trial, and was there pronounced a good article.
Since then it has been mined by the Company, not
only for their own uses, but also for export to California.
In making these statements, I rely particularly
upon Golowin, in the “Archiv” of Erman, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
upon the elaborate work of Grewingk, in the “Transactions
of the Mineralogical Society of St. Petersburg”
for 1848 and 1849,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> where is a special map of the
Kenaian peninsula.</p>

<p>Gold is less important than coal, but its discovery
produces more excitement. The report of gold in any
quarter stimulates the emigrant or the adventurer hoping
to obtain riches swiftly. Nor is this distant region
without such experience. Only a few years ago, the
British colony of Victoria was aroused by a rumor of
gold in the mountains of the Stikine River, not far in
the interior from Sitka. At once there was a race that
way, and the solitudes of this river were penetrated by
hunters in quest of the glittering ore. Discomfiture
ensued. Gold had been found, but not in any sufficient
quantities reasonably accessible. Nature for the present
had set up obstacles. But failure in one place will
be no discouragement in another, especially as there is
reason to believe that the mountains here contain a
continuation of those auriferous deposits which have
become so famous further south. The Sierra Nevada
chain of California reaches here.</p>

<p>Traces of gold have been observed at other points.
One report places a deposit not far from Sitka. The
same writer who reports iron also reports that during
the last year he saw a piece of gold as large as a marble,
which was shown by an Indian. But the Russian engineer,
Doroschin, furnishes testimony more precise. He
reports gold in at least three different localities, each
of considerable extent. The first is the mountain range
on the north of Cook’s Inlet and extending into the
peninsula of Alaska, consisting principally of clay slate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
with permeating veins of diorite, the latter being known
as a gold-bearing rock. He observed this in the summer
of 1851. About the same time, certain Indians
from the Bay of Yakutat, not far from Mount St. Elias,
brought him specimens of diorite found in their neighborhood,
making, therefore, a second deposit. In the
summer of 1855, the same engineer found gold on the
southern side of Cook’s Inlet, in the mountains of the
Kenay peninsula. Satisfying himself, first, that the
bank occupied by the redoubt of St. Nicholas, at the
mouth of the Kaknu River, was gold-bearing, he was
induced to follow the development of diorite in the
upper valley of the river, and, as he ascended, found
a gold-bearing alluvion, gradually increasing, with scales
of gold becoming coarser and coarser, instead of scarcely
visible, as at first.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the discoveries on Cook’s
Inlet were pursued; but it is reported that the Hudson’s
Bay Company, holding the country about the Bay
of Yakutat under a lease from the Russian Company,
have found the diorite in that neighborhood valuable.
This incident has given rise to a recent controversy.
Russian journals attacked the engineer for remissness
in not exploring the Yakutat country. He has defended
himself by setting out what he actually did in the way
of discovery, and the essential difficulty at the time in
doing more: all which will be found in a number, just
received, of the work to which I have so often referred,
the “Archiv” of Erman, for 1867.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Thus much for the mineral resources of this new-found
country, as recognized at a few points on the extensive
coast, leaving the vast unknown interior without
a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>6. <i>Furs.</i>&mdash;I pass now to Furs, which at times have
vied with minerals in value, although the supply is more
limited and less permanent. Trappers are “miners” of
the forest, seeking furs as others seek gold. The parallel
continues also in the greed and oppression unhappily
incident to the pursuit. A Russian officer, who
was one of the early visitors on this coast, remarks that
to his mind the only prospect of relief for the suffering
natives “consists in the total extirpation of the animals
of the chase,” which he thought, from the daily havoc,
must take place in a very few years.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> This was at the
close of the last century. The trade, though essentially
diminished, still continues an important branch of commerce.</p>

<p>Early in this commerce, desirable furs were obtained
in barter for a trifle; and when something of value was
exchanged, it was much out of proportion to the furs.
This has been the case generally in dealing with the
natives, until their eyes have been slowly opened. In
Kamtchatka, at the beginning of the last century, half
a dozen sables were obtained in exchange for a knife,
and a dozen for a hatchet; and the Kamtchadales wondered
that their Cossack conquerors were willing to
pay so largely for what seemed worth so little. Similar
incidents on the Northwest Coast are reported by
the early navigators. Cook mentions that in exchange
for “beads” the Indians at Prince William Sound
“readily gave whatever they had, even their fine sea-otter
skins,” which they prized no more than other
skins, until it appeared how much they were prized
by their visitors.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Where there was no competition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
prices rose slowly, and many years after Cook, the
Russians at Oonalaska, in return for “trinkets and tobacco,”
received twelve sea-otter skins, and fox skins
of different kinds to the number of near six hundred.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
These instances show in a general way the spirit of
this trade even to our own day. On the coast, and
especially in the neighborhood of the factories, the difference
in the value of furs is recognized, and a proportionate
price obtained, which Sir Edward Belcher
found in 1837 to be for “a moderately good sea-otter
skin from six to seven blankets, increasing to thirteen
for the best,” together with “sundry knick-knacks.”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
But in the interior it is otherwise. A recent resident
in the region of the Yukon assures me that he has seen
skins worth several hundred dollars bartered for goods
worth only fifty cents.</p>

<p>Beside whalers and casual ships, with which the Esquimaux
are in the habit of dealing, the commerce in
furs, on both sides of the continent, north of the United
States, has for a long time been in the hands of two
corporations,&mdash;being the Hudson’s Bay Company, with
directors in London, and the Russian American Company,
with directors in St. Petersburg. The former is
much the older of the two, and has been the most
flourishing. Its original members were none other than
Prince Rupert, the Duke of Albemarle, Earl Craven,
Lord Ashley, and other eminent associates, who received
a charter from Charles the Second, in 1670, to
prosecute a search after a new passage to the South
Sea, and to establish a trade in furs, minerals, and other
considerable commodities in all those seas, and in the
British possessions north and west of Canada, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
powers of government, the whole constituting a colossal
monopoly, which stretched from Labrador and Baffin’s
Bay to an undefined West. At present this great
corporation is known only as a fur company, to which
all its powers are tributary. For some time its profits
were so considerable that it was deemed advisable to
hide them by nominal additions to the stock. With
the extinction of the St. Petersburg corporation under
the present treaty, the London corporation will remain
the only existing fur company on the continent, but
necessarily restricted in its operation to British territory.
It remains to be seen into whose hands the commerce
on the Pacific side will fall, now that this whole
region will be open to the unchecked enterprise of our
citizens.</p>

<p>This remarkable commerce began before the organization
of the Russian Company. Its profits may be inferred
from a voyage in 1772, described by Coxe, between
Kamtchatka and the Aleutians. The tenth part
of the skins being handed to the custom-house, the remainder
were distributed in fifty-five shares, consisting
each of twenty sea-otters, sixteen black and brown
foxes, ten red foxes, and three sea-otter tails; and these
shares were sold on the spot at from eight hundred to
one thousand rubles each, so that the whole lading
brought about fifty thousand rubles.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The cost of these
may be inferred from the articles given in exchange.
A Russian outfit, of which I find a contemporary record,
was, among other things, “about five hundred weight
of tobacco, one hundred weight of glass beads, perhaps
a dozen spare hatchets and a few superfluous knives of
very bad quality, an immense number of traps for foxes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
a few hams, a little rancid butter.”<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> With such imports
against such exports, the profits must have been
considerable.</p>

<p>From Langsdorff we have a general inventory of furs
at the beginning of the century in the principal magazine
of the Russian Company on the island of Kadiak,
drawn from the islands, the peninsula of Alaska, Cook’s
Inlet, Prince William Sound, and the continent generally.
Here were “a great variety of the rarest kinds
of fox skins,” black, blackish, reddish, silver gray, and
stone fox,&mdash;the last probably a species of the Arctic;
“brown and red bears, the skins of which are of great
value,” and also “the valuable black bear”; the zisel
marmot, and the common marmot; the glutton; the
lynx, chiefly of whitish gray; the reindeer; the beaver;
the hairy hedgehog; “the wool of a wild American
sheep, whitish, fine, and very long,” but he could never
obtain sight of the animal that produced this wool;
also sea-otters, once “the principal source of wealth
to the Company, now nearly extirpated, a few hundreds
only being annually collected.”<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Many of the
same furs were reported by Cook on this coast in his
day. They all continue to be found,&mdash;except that I
hear nothing of wild sheep, save at a Sitkan dinner.</p>

<p>There has been much exaggeration with regard to
the profits of the Russian corporation. An English
writer of authority calls the produce “immense,” and
adds that “formerly it was much greater.” I refer to
the paper of Mr. Petermann, read before the Royal Geographical
Society of London, in 1852.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The number of
skins at times is prodigious, although this fails to reveal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
precisely the profits. For instance, Pribyloff collected
within two years, on the islands northwest of Alaska
which bear his name, the skins of 2,000 sea-otters,
40,000 sea-bears or ursine seals, 6,000 dark ice-foxes,
together with 1,000 poods of walrus ivory.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The pood
is a Russian weight of thirty-six pounds. Lütke mentions
that in 1803 no less than 800,000 skins of the
ursine seal were accumulated in the factory at Oonalaska,
of which 700,000 were thrown into the sea, partly
because they were badly prepared, and partly to keep
up the price,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>&mdash;thus imitating the Dutch, who for the
same reason burned spices. Another estimate masses
the collection for a series of years. From 1787 to
1817, for only part of which time the Company existed,
the Oonalaska district yielded upwards of 2,500,000
seal-skins; and from 1817 to 1838, during all which
time the Company was in power, the same district
yielded 879,000 seal-skins. Assuming, what is improbable,
that these skins were sold at twenty-five rubles
each, some calculating genius has ciphered out the sum-total
of proceeds at more than 85,000,000 rubles,&mdash;or,
calling the ruble seventy-five cents, a sum-total of more
than $63,000,000. Clearly, the latter years can show
no approximation to any such doubtful result.</p>

<p>Descending from these lofty figures, which, if not exaggerations,
are at least generalities, and relate partly
to earlier periods, before the existence of the Company,
we shall have a better idea of the commerce, if we look
at authentic reports for special periods. Admiral Von
Wrangell, who was so long governor, must have been
well informed. According to statements in his work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
adopted also by Wappäus in his “Geographie,” the
Company, from 1826 to 1833, a period of seven years,
exported to Russia the skins of the following animals:
9,853 sea-otters, with 8,751 sea-otter tails, 39,981 river-beavers,
6,242 river or land otters, 5,243 black foxes,
7,759 black-bellied foxes, 16,336 red foxes, 24,189 polar
foxes, 1,093 lynxes, 559 wolverenes, 2,976 sables, 4,335
swamp-otters, 69 wolves, 1,261 bears, 505 musk-rats,
132,160 seals; also 830 poods of whalebone, 1,490
poods of walrus-teeth, and 7,121 pairs of castoreum.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
Their value does not appear. Sir George Simpson, the
Governor-in-chief of the Hudson’s Bay Company, who
was at Sitka in 1841, represents the returns of the
Company for that year, 10,000 fur-seals, 1,000 sea-otters,
2,500 land-otters, 12,000 beavers, and 20,000
walrus-teeth, without including foxes and martens.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
There is a report for the year 1852, as follows: 1,231
sea-otters, 129 young sea-otters, 2,948 common otters,
14,486 fur-seals, 107 bears, 13,300 beavers, 2 wolves,
458 sables, 243 lynxes, 163 mole-skins, 1,504 pairs of
castoreum, 684 black foxes, 1,590 cross foxes, 5,174 red
foxes, 2,359 blue Arctic foxes, 355 white Arctic foxes,
and also 31 foxes called white, perhaps albinos.</p>

<p>Besides these reports for special years, I am enabled
to present, from the Russian tables of Captain Golowin,
another, covering the period from 1842 to 1860, inclusive,&mdash;being
25,602 sea-otters, 63,826 otters, probably
river-otters, 161,042 beavers, 73,944 foxes, 55,540 Arctic
foxes, 2,283 bears, 6,445 lynxes, 26,384 sables, 19,076
musk-rats, 2,536 ursine seals, 338,604 marsh-otters, 712
brace of hare, 451 martens, 104 wolves, 46,274 castoreums,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
7,309 beavers’ tails. Here is an inexplicable
absence of seal-skins. On the other hand are sables,
which belong to Asia, and not to America. The list
is Russian, and perhaps embraces furs from the Asiatic
islands of the Company.</p>

<p>From a competent source I learn that the value of
skins at Sitka during the last year was substantially
as follows: Sea-otter, $50; marten, $4; beaver, $2.50;
bear, $4.50; black fox, $50; silver fox, $40; cross fox,
$25; red fox, $2. A recent price-current in New York
gives the following prices there in currency: Silver fox,
$10 to $50; cross fox, $3 to $5; red fox, $1 to $1.50;
otter, $3 to $6; mink, $3 to $6; beaver, $1 to $4;
musk-rat, $0.20 to $0.50; lynx, $2 to $4; black bear,
$6 to $12; dark marten, $5 to $20. These New York
prices vary from those of Sitka. The latter are the better
guide to a comprehension of the proceeds at Sitka,
subject to deduction for the expenses of the Company.
Of the latter I say nothing now, as I have considered
them in speaking of the existing Government.</p>

<p>The skins are obtained in three different ways: first,
through the hunters employed by the Company; secondly,
in payment of taxes imposed by the Company;
and, thirdly, by barter or purchase from independent
natives. But, with all these sources, it is certain that
the Russian Company has enjoyed no success comparable
to that of its British rival; and, still more, there
is reason to believe that latterly its profits have not
been large.</p>

<p>Amid all the concealment or obscurity which prevails
with regard to revenues, it is easy to see that for
some time to come there must be a large amount of
valuable furs on this coast. The bountiful solitudes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the forest and of the adjoining waters have not yet
been exhausted; nor will they be, until civilization has
supplied substitutes. Such, indeed, is part of that humane
law of compensation which contributes to the
general harmony. For the present there will be trappers
on the land, who will turn aside only a little from
prizes there to obtain from the sea its otter, seal, and
walrus. It cannot be irrelevant, and may not be without
interest, if I call attention briefly to those fur-bearing
animals which are about to be brought within
the sphere of republican government. If we cannot
find their exact census, we may at least learn something
of their character and value.</p>

<p>The comparative poverty of vegetation in the more
northern parts of the continent contrasts with the abundance
of animal life, especially if we embrace those
tenants of the sea who seek the land for rest. These
northern parallels are hardly less productive than the
tropics. The lion, the elephant, and the hippopotamus
find their counterpart in the bear, the walrus, and the
seal, without including the sables and the foxes. Here
again Nature, by unerring law, adapts the animal to the
climate, and in providing him with needful protection
creates also a needful supply for the protection of man;
and this is the secret of rich furs. Under the sun of the
tropics such provision is as little needed by man as by
beast; and therefore Nature, which does nothing inconsistent
with wise economy, reserves it for other places.</p>

<p>Among the furs most abundant in this commerce
are those of the fox, in its different species and under
its different names. Its numbers were noticed early,
and gave the name to the eastern group of the Aleutians,
which were called Lyssie Ostrowa, or Fox Islands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Some of its furs are among the very precious. The
most plentiful is the red, or, as sometimes called, American;
but this is not highly prized. Then comes the
Arctic, of little value, and of different colors, sometimes
blue, and in full winter dress pure white, whose circumpolar
home is indicated by its name. The cross
fox is less known, but much more sought, from the
fineness of its fur and its color. Its name is derived
from dark cruciform stripes, extending from the head
to the back and at right angles over the shoulders. It
is now recognized to be a variety of the red, from which
it differs more in commercial value than in general
character. The black fox, which is sometimes entirely
of shining black with silver white at the tip of the tail,
is called also the silver fox, when the black hairs of the
body are tipped with white. They are of the same
name in science, sometimes called <i>argentatus</i>, although
there seem to be two different names, if not different
values, in commerce. This variety is more rare than the
cross fox. Not more than four or five are taken during
a season at any one post in the fur countries, although
the hunters use every art for this purpose. The temptation
is great, as we are told that “its fur fetches
six times the price of any other fur produced in North
America.”<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Sir John Richardson, the authority for this
statement, forgot the sea-otter, of which he seems to
have known little. Without doubt, the black fox is
admired for rarity and beauty. La Hontan, the French
commander in Canada under Louis the Fourteenth,
speaks of its fur in his time as worth its weight in
gold.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the animals whose furs are less regarded are
the wolverene, known in science as <i>Gulo</i>, or glutton,
and called by Buffon the “quadruped vulture,” with a
dark brown fur, becoming black in winter, and resembling
that of the bear, but not so long, nor of so much
value. There is also the lynx, belonging to the feline
race, living north of the Great Lakes and eastward of
the Rocky Mountains, with a fur moderately prized in
commerce. There is also the musk-rat, which is abundant
in Russian America, as it is common on this continent,
whose fur enters largely into the cheaper peltries
of the United States in so many different ways,
and with such various artificial colors that the animal
would not know his own skin.</p>

<p>Among inferior furs I may include that very respectable
animal, the black bear, reported by Cook “in great
numbers,” and “of a shining black color.”<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The grizzly
bear is less frequent, and is inferior in quality of fur to
all other varieties of the bear. The brown bear is supposed
to be a variety of the black bear. The polar bear,
which at times is a formidable animal, leaving a footprint
in the snow nine inches long, was once said not
to make an appearance west of the Mackenzie River;
but he has been latterly found on Behring Strait, so
that he, too, is included among our new population.
The black bear, in himself a whole population, inhabits
every wooded district from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
and from Carolina to the ice of the Arctic, being
more numerous inland than on the coast. Langsdorff
early remarked that he did not appear on the Aleutians,
but on the continent, about Cook’s Inlet and
Prince William Sound, which are well wooded.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
has been found even on the Isthmus of Panama. Next
to the dog, he is the most cosmopolitan and perhaps
the most intelligent of animals, and among those of
the forest he is the most known, even to the nursery.
His showy fur once enjoyed great vogue in hammer-cloths
and muffs, and it is still used in military caps
and pistol-holsters; so that he is sometimes called the
Army bear. Latterly the fur has fallen in value. Once
it brought in London from twenty to forty guineas. It
will now hardly bring more than the same number of
shillings.</p>

<p>The beaver, amphibious and intelligent, has a considerable
place in commerce, and also a notoriety of its
own as the familiar synonym for the common covering
of a man’s head; and here the animal becomes historic.
By royal proclamation, in 1638, Charles the First
of England commanded “that no beaver-makers whatsoever,
from henceforth, shall make any hats or caps
but of pure beaver.”<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> This proclamation was the death-warrant
of beavers innumerable, sacrificed to the demands
of the trade. Wherever they existed over a wide
extent of country, in the shelter of forests or in lodges
built by their extraordinary instinct, they were pursued
and arrested in their busy work. The importation of
their skins into Europe during the last century was
enormous, and it continued until one year it is said to
have reached the unaccountable number of 600,000. I
give these figures as I find them. Latterly other materials
have been obtained for hats, so that this fur has
become less valuable. But the animal is still hunted.
A medicine supplied by him, and known as the castoreum,
has a fixed place in the Materia Medica.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>The marten is perhaps the most popular of all the
fur-bearing animals belonging to our new possessions.
An inhabitant of the whole wooded region of the northern
part of the continent, he finds a favorite home in
the forests of the Yukon, where he needs his beautiful
fur, which is not much inferior to that of his near
relative, the far-famed Russian sable. In the trade of
the Hudson’s Bay Company the marten occupies the
largest place, his skins for a single district amounting
to more than fifty thousand annually, and being sometimes
sold as sable. The ermine, which is of the same
weasel family, is of little value except for its captivating
name, although its fur finds a way to the English
market in enormous quantities. The mink, also of
the same general family, was once little regarded, but
now, by freak of fashion in our country, this animal
has ascended in value above the beaver, and almost to
the level of the marten. His fur is plentiful on the
Yukon and along the coast. Specimens in the museum
of the Smithsonian Institution attest its occurrence at
Sitka.</p>

<p>The seal, amphibious, polygamous, and intelligent as
the beaver, has always supplied the largest multitude
of furs to the Russian Company. The early navigators
describe its appearance and numbers. Cook encountered
them constantly. Excellent swimmers, ready
divers, they seek rocks and recesses for repose, where,
though watchful and never sleeping long without moving,
they become the prey of the hunter. Early in
the century there was a wasteful destruction of them.
Young and old, male and female, were indiscriminately
knocked on the head for the sake of their skins. Sir
George Simpson, who saw this improvidence with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
experienced eye, says that it was hurtful in two ways:
first, the race was almost exterminated; and, secondly,
the market was glutted sometimes with as many as
two hundred thousand a year, so that prices did not
pay the expense of carriage.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> The Russians were led to
adopt the plan of the Hudson’s Bay Company, killing
only a limited number of males who had attained their
full growth, which can be done easily, from the known
and systematic habits of the animal. Under this economy
seals have multiplied again, vastly increasing the
supply.</p>

<p>Besides the common seal, there are various species,
differing in appearance, so as to justify different names,
and yet all with a family character,&mdash;including the
sea-leopard, so named from his spots, the elephant seal,
from his tusks and proboscis, and the sea-lion, with
teeth, mane, and a thick cylindrical body. These are of
little value, although their skins are occasionally employed.
The skin of the elephant seal is strong, so as
to justify its use in the harness of horses. There is
also the sea-bear, or ursine seal, very numerous in these
waters, whose skin, especially if young, is prized for
clothing. Steller speaks with grateful remembrance of
a garment he made from one, while on the desert island
after the shipwreck of Behring.</p>

<p>Associated with the seal, and belonging to the same
family, is the walrus, called by the British the sea-horse,
the morse, or the sea-cow, and by the French
<i>bête à la grande dent</i>. His two tusks, rather than his
skin, are the prize of the hunter. Unlike the rest of
the seal family, he is monogamous, and not polygamous.
Cook vividly describes immense herds asleep on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
ice, with some of their number on guard, and, when
aroused, roaring or braying very loud, while they huddled
and tumbled together like swine.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> At times their
multitude is so great, that, before being aroused, several
hundreds are slaughtered, as game in a park. Their
hide is excellent for carriage-braces, and is useful about
ship. But it is principally for their ivory that these
hecatombs are sacrificed. A single tooth sometimes
weighs several pounds. Twenty thousand teeth, reported
as an annual harvest of the Russian Company,
must cost the lives of ten thousand walruses. The
ivory compares with that of the elephant, and is for
some purposes superior. Long ago, in the days of Saxon
history, a Norwegian at the court of Alfred exhibited
to the king “teeth of great price and excellencie,”
from what he called a “horsewhale.”<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Unquestionably,
they were teeth of walrus.</p>

<p>I mention the sea-otter last; but in beauty and value
it is the first. In these respects it far surpasses the
river or land otter, which, though beautiful and valuable,
must yield the palm. It has also more the manners
of the seal, with the same fondness for sea-washed
rocks, and a maternal affection almost human. The
sea-otter seems to belong exclusively to the North Pacific.
Its haunts once extended as far south as the
Bay of San Francisco, but long ago it ceased to appear
in that region. Cook saw it at Nootka Sound.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Vancouver
reports in Chatham Strait an “immense number
about the shores in all directions,” so that “it was
easily in the power of the natives to procure as many
as they chose to be at the trouble of taking.”<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> D’Wolf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
while at Sitka, projected an expedition to California
“for the purpose of catching sea-otter, those animals
being very numerous on that coast.”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> But these navigators,
could they revisit this coast, would not find it
in these places now. Its present zone is between the
parallels of 50° and 60° north latitude, on the American
and Asiatic coasts, so that its range is comparatively
limited. Evidently it was Cook who first revealed
the sea-otter to Englishmen. In the table of
contents of his second volume are the words, “Description
of a Sea-Otter,” and in the text is a minute account
of this animal, and especially of its incomparable
fur, “certainly softer and finer than that of any others
we know of.” Not content with description, the famous
navigator adds, in remarkable words, “Therefore the discovery
of this part of the continent of North America,
where so valuable an article of commerce may be met
with, cannot be a matter of indifference.”<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> This account
stimulated the commercial enterprise of that
day. Other witnesses followed. Meares, describing his
voyage, placed this fur high above all other furs,&mdash;“the
finest in the world, and of exceeding beauty”;<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
and La Pérouse made it known in France as “the most
precious and the most common peltry” of those regions.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
Shortly afterwards all existing information with
regard to it was elaborately set forth in the Historical
Introduction to the Voyage of Marchand, published at
Paris under the auspices of the Institute.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>The sea-otter was known originally to the Russians
in Kamtchatka, where it was called the sea-beaver; but
the discoveries of Behring constitute an epoch in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
commerce. His shipwrecked crew, compelled to winter
on the desert island now bearing his name, found
this animal in flocks, ignorant of men and innocent as
sheep, so that they were slaughtered without resistance,
to the number of “near nine hundred.”<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Their value
became known. Fabulous prices were paid by the Chinese,
sometimes, according to Coxe, as high as one hundred
and forty rubles.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> At such a price a single sea-otter
was more than five ounces of gold, and a flock
was a gold mine. The pursuit of gold was renewed.
It was the sea-otter that tempted the navigator, and
subsequent enterprise was under the incentive of obtaining
the precious fur. Müller, calling him a beaver,
says, in his history of Russian Discovery, “The catching
of beavers in those parts enticed many people to go
to them, and they never returned without great quantities,
which always produced large profits.”<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> All that
could be obtained were sent to China, which was the
objective point commercially for this whole coast. The
trade became a fury. The animal, with exquisite purple-black
fur, appeared only to be killed,&mdash;not always
without effort, for he had learned something of his
huntsman, and was now coy and watchful, so that the
pursuit was often an effort; but his capture was always
a triumph. The natives, accustomed to his furs
as clothing, now surrendered them. Sometimes a few
beads were the only pay. All the navigators speak of
the unequal barter,&mdash;“any sort of beads,” according to
Cook.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The story is best told by Meares: “Such as
were dressed in furs instantly stripped themselves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
in return for a moderate quantity of large spike-nails
we received sixty fine sea-otter skins.”<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Vancouver describes
the “humble fashion” of the natives in poor
skins as a substitute for the beautiful furs appropriated
by “their Russian friends.”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The picture is completed
by the Russian navigator, when he confesses, that, after
the Russians had any intercourse with them, the natives
ceased to wear sea-otter skins.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> In the growing
rage the sea-otter nearly disappeared. Langsdorff reports
the race “nearly extirpated,” since “the high price
given for the skins induces the Russians, for the sake
of a momentary advantage, to kill all they meet with,
both old and young; nor can they see that by such a
procedure they must soon be deprived of the trade entirely.”<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
This was in 1805. Since then the indiscriminate
massacre has been arrested.</p>

<p>Meanwhile our countrymen entered into this commerce,
so that Russians, Englishmen, and Americans
were all engaged in slaughtering sea-otters, and selling
their furs to the Chinese, until the market of Canton
was glutted. Lisiansky, who was there in 1806,
speaks of “immense quantities imported by American
ships,&mdash;during the present season no less than twenty
thousand.”<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> By-and-by the commerce was engrossed
by the Russians and English. At length it passes into
the hands of the United States, with all the other prerogatives
belonging to this territory.</p>

<p>7. <i>Fisheries.</i>&mdash;I come now to the Fisheries, the last
head of this inquiry, and not inferior to any other in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
importance,&mdash;perhaps the most important of all. What
even are sea-otter skins, by the side of that product of
the sea, incalculable in amount, which contributes to
the sustenance of the human family?</p>

<p>Here, as elsewhere, in the endeavor to estimate the
resources of this region, there is vagueness and uncertainty.
Information is wanting; and yet we are not
entirely ignorant. Nothing is clearer than that fish in
great abundance are taken everywhere on the coast,
around the islands, in the bays, and throughout the adjacent
seas. The evidence is constant and complete.
Here are oysters, clams, crabs, and a dainty little fish
of the herring tribe, called the oolachan, contributing
to the luxury of the table, and so rich in its oily nature
that the natives are said to use it sometimes as
a “candle.” In addition to these, which I name only
to put aside, are those great staples of commerce and
main-stays of daily subsistence, the salmon, the herring,
the halibut, the cod, and, behind all, the whale. This
short list is enough, for it offers a constant feast, with
the whale at hand for light. Here is the best that the
sea affords, for poor or rich,&mdash;for daily use, or the fast-days
of the Church. Here also is a sure support, at
least, to the inhabitants of the coast.</p>

<p>To determine the value of this supply, we must go
further, and ascertain if these various tribes of fish,
reputed to be in such numbers, are found under such
conditions and in such places as to constitute a permanent
and profitable fishery. This is the practical
question, which is still undecided. It is not enough
to show that the whole coast may be subsisted by its
fish. It should be shown further that the fish of this
coast can be made to subsist other places, so as to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
a valuable article of commerce. And here uncertainty
begins. The proper conditions of an extensive
fishery are not yet understood. It is known that
certain fisheries exist in certain waters and on certain
soundings, but the spaces of ocean are obscure, even to
the penetrating eye of science. Fishing-banks known
for ages are still in many respects a mystery, which
is increased where the fishery is recent or only coastwise.
There are other banks which fail from local
incidents. Thus, very lately a cod-fishery was commenced
on Rockall Bank, one hundred and sixty-five
miles northwest of the Hebrides, but the deep rolling
of the Atlantic and the intolerable weather compelled
its abandonment.</p>

<p>Before considering the capacity of this region for an
extensive fishery, it is important to know such evidence
as exists with regard to the supply; and here again we
must resort to the early navigators and visitors. Their
evidence, reinforced by modern reports, is an essential
element, even if it does not entirely determine the question.</p>

<p>Down to the arrival of Europeans, the natives lived
on fish. This had been their constant food, with small
additions from the wild vegetation. In summer it was
fish freshly caught; in winter it was fish dried or preserved.
At the first landing, on the discovery, Steller
found in the deserted cellar “store of red salmon,”
and the sailors brought away “smoked fishes that appeared
like large carp and tasted very well.”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> This is
the earliest notice of fish on this coast, which are thus
directly associated with its discovery. The next of interest
is the account of a Russian navigator, in 1768-9,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
who reports at the Fox Islands, and especially Oonalaska,
“cod, perch, pilchards, smelts, roach.”<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Thus
early the cod appears.</p>

<p>Repairing to Cook’s Voyage, we find the accustomed
instruction; and here I shall quote with all possible
brevity. At Nootka Sound he finds fish “more plentiful
than birds,” of which the principal sorts, in great
numbers, are “the common herring, but scarcely exceeding
seven inches in length, and a smaller sort, the
same with the anchovy or sardine,” and now and then
“a small brownish cod spotted with white.”<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Then
again he reports at the same place “herrings and sardines,
and small cod,”&mdash;the former “not only eaten
fresh, but likewise dried and smoked.”<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> In Prince
William Sound “the only fish got were some torsk and
halibut, chiefly brought by the natives to sell.”<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Near
Kadiak he records, that, “having three hours’ calm,
our people caught upward of a hundred halibuts, some
of which weighed a hundred pounds, and none less
than twenty pounds,”&mdash;and he adds, naturally enough,
“a very seasonable refreshment to us.”<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> In Bristol
Bay, on the northern side of the promontory of Alaska,
he reports “tolerable success in fishing, catching cod,
and now and then a few flat-fish.”<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> In Norton Sound,
still further north, he tells us, that, in exchange for
four knives made from an old iron hoop, he obtained
of the natives “near four hundred pounds weight of
fish, which they had caught on this or the preceding
day,&mdash;some trout, and the rest in size and taste somewhat
between a mullet and a herring.”<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> On returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
southward, stopping at Oonalaska, he finds “plenty of
fish, at first mostly salmon, both fresh and dried,&mdash;some
of the fresh salmon in high perfection”; also
“salmon trout, and once a halibut that weighed two
hundred and fifty-four pounds”; and in describing the
habits of the islanders, he reports that “they dry large
quantities of fish in summer, which they lay up in
small huts for winter use.”<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Such is the testimony of
Captain Cook.</p>

<p>No experience on the coast is more instructive than
that of Portlock, and from his report I compile a succinct
diary. July 20, 1786, at Graham’s Harbor, Cook’s
Inlet, “The Russian chief brought me as a present a
quantity of fine salmon, sufficient to serve both ships
for one day.” July 21, “In several hauls caught about
thirty salmon and a few flat-fish”; also, further, “The
Russian settlement had on one side a small lake of
fresh water, in which they catch plenty of fine salmon.”
July 22, “The boat returned deeply loaded with
fine salmon.” July 28, latitude 60° 9´, “Two small canoes
came off from the shore; they had nothing to barter
except a few dried salmon.” July 30, “Plenty of
excellent fresh salmon, which we obtained for beads and
buttons.” August 5, “Plenty of fine salmon.” August
9, “The greatest abundance of fine salmon.” August
13, off the entrance of Cook’s Inlet, “Hereabouts would
be a most desirable situation for carrying on a whale
fishery, the whales being on the coast and close in
shore in vast numbers, and there being convenient and
excellent harbors quite handy for the business.”<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Soon
after these entries the English navigator left the coast
for the Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>Returning during the next year, Portlock continued
to record his observations, which I abstract in brief.
May 21, 1787, Port Etches, latitude 60° 21´, “The harbor
affords very fine crabs and muscles.” June 4, “A
few Indians came alongside, bringing some halibut and
cod.” June 20, “Plenty of flounders; crabs now very
fine; some of the people, in fishing alongside for flounders,
caught several cod and halibut.” June 22, “Sent
the canoe out some distance into the bay, and it soon
returned with a load of fine halibut and cod; this success
induced me to send her out frequently with a fishing
party, and they caught considerably more than what
was sufficient for daily consumption.” June 30, “In
hauling the seine, we caught a large quantity of herrings
and some salmon; the herrings, though small, were very
good, and two hogsheads of them were salted for sea-store.”
July 7, “We daily caught large quantities of
salmon, but, the unsettled state of the weather not permitting
us to cure them on board, I sent the boatswain
with a party on shore to build a kind of house to smoke
them in.” July 11, “The seine was frequently hauled,
and not less than two thousand salmon were caught at
each haul; the weather, however, preventing us from
curing them so well as could have been wished, we
kept only a sufficient quantity for present use, and let
the rest escape. The salmon were now in such numbers
along the shores that any quantity whatever might
be caught with the greatest ease.”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> All this testimony
of the English navigator is singularly explicit, while it
is in complete harmony with that of the Russian visitors,
and of Cook, who preceded Portlock.</p>

<p>The report of Meares is similar, although less minute.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Speaking of the natives generally, he says, “They live
entirely upon fish, but of all others they prefer the
whale.”<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Then again, going into more detail, he says,
“Vast quantities of fish are to be found, both on the
coast and in the sounds or harbors. Among these are
the halibut, herring, sardine, silver-bream, salmon, trout,
cod, … all of which we have seen in the possession
of the natives, or have been caught by ourselves.” The
sardines he describes as taken in such numbers “that
a whole village has not been able to cleanse them.”
At Nootka the salmon was “of a very delicate flavor,”
and “the cod taken by the natives were of the best
quality.”<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Spanish and French testimony is not wanting, although
less precise. Maurelle, who was on the coast
in 1779, remarks that “the fish most abundant was the
salmon and a species of sole or turbot.”<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> La Pérouse,
who was there in 1786, mentions a large fish weighing
sometimes more than a hundred pounds, and several
other fish; but he preferred “the salmon and trout,
which the Indians sold in larger numbers than could
be consumed.”<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> A similar report was made in 1791
by Marchand, who finds the sea and rivers abounding
in “excellent fish,” particularly salmon and trout.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile came the Russian navigator Billings, in
1790; and here we have a similar report, only different
in form. Describing the natives of Oonalaska, the
book in which this visit is recorded says, “They dry
salmon, cod, and halibut, for a winter’s supply.”<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> At
Kadiak it says, “Whales are in amazing numbers about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the straits of the islands and in the vicinity of Kadiak.”
Then the reporter, who was the naturalist Sauer, says,
“I observed the same species of salmon here as at
Okhotsk, and saw crabs.” Again, “The halibuts in
these seas are extremely large, some weighing seventeen
poods, or six hundred and twelve pounds avoirdupois.…
The liver of this fish, as also of cod, the
natives esteem unhealthy and never eat, but extract
the oil from them.”<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Then, returning to Oonalaska the
next year, the naturalist says, “The other fish are halibut,
cod, two or three species of salmon, and sometimes
a species of salmon very common in Kamtchatka, between
four and five feet long.”<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>From Lisiansky, the Russian navigator, who was on
the coast in 1804, and again in 1805, I take two passages.
The first relates to the fish of Sitka. “For some
time,” he says, “we had been able to catch no fish but
the halibut. Those of this species, however, which we
caught were fine, some of them weighing eighteen stone,
and were of an excellent flavor. This fish abounds here
from March to November, when it retires from the
coast till the winter is at an end.”<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> The other passage
relates to the subsistence of the inhabitants during the
winter. “They live,” he says, “on dried salmon, train
oil, and the spawn of fish, especially that of herrings,
of which they always lay in a good stock.”<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>Langsdorff, who was there in 1805-6, is more full
and explicit. Of Oonalaska he says: “The principal
food consists of fish, sea-dogs, and the flesh of whales.
Among the fish, the most common and most abundant
are several sorts of salmon, cod, herrings, and holybutt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
The holybutts, which are the sort held in the highest
esteem, are sometimes of an enormous size, weighing
even several hundred pounds.”<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Of Kadiak he
says: “The most common fish, those which, fresh and
dry, constitute a principal article of food, are herrings,
cod, holybutt, and several sorts of salmon; the latter
come up into the bays and rivers at stated seasons and
months, and are then taken in prodigious numbers by
means of nets or dams.”<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Of Sitka he says: “We have
several sorts of salmon, holybutt, whitings, cod, and herrings.”<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
A goodly variety. The testimony of Langsdorff
is confirmed in general terms by his contemporary,
D’Wolf, who reports: “The waters of the neighborhood
abounded with numerous and choice varieties
of the finny tribe, which could be taken at all seasons
of the year.”<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>Lütke, also a Russian, tells us that he found fish the
standing dish at Sitka, from the humblest servant to
the governor; and he mentions salmon, herring, cod, and
turbot. Of salmon there were no less than four kinds,
which were eaten fresh when possible, but after June
they were sent to the fortress salted. The herring appeared
in February and March. The cod and turbot
were caught in the straits during winter.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Lütke also
reports “fresh cod” at Kadiak.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>I close this abstract of foreign testimony with two
English authorities often quoted. Sir Edward Belcher,
while on the coast in 1837, records that “fish, halibut,
and salmon of two kinds, were abundant and moderate,
of which the crews purchased and cured great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
quantities.”<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Sir George Simpson, who was at Sitka in 1841,
says: “Halibut, cod, herrings, flounders, and many other
sorts of fish, are always to be had for the taking, in
unlimited quantities.… Salmon have been known literally
to embarrass the movements of a canoe. About
100,000 of the last-mentioned fish, equivalent to 1,500
barrels, are annually salted for the use of the establishment.”<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
Nothing could be stronger as statement, and,
when we consider the character of its author, nothing
stronger as authority.</p>

<p>Cumulative upon all this accumulation of testimony
is that of recent visitors. Nobody visits here without
testifying. The fish are so demonstrative in abundance
that all remark it. Officers of the United States navy
report the same fish substantially which Cook reported,
as far north as the Frozen Ocean. Scientific explorers,
prompted by the Smithsonian Institution, report cod
in Behring Strait, on the limits of the Arctic Circle.
One of these reports, that, while anchored near Oonimak,
in 1865, the ship, with a couple of lines, caught
“a great many fine cod, most of them between two
and three feet in length.” He supposes that there is
no place on the coast where they are not numerous.
A citizen of Massachusetts, who has recently returned
from prolonged residence on this coast, writes me from
Boston, under date of March 8, 1867, that “the whale
and cod fisheries of the North Pacific are destined to
form a very important element in the wealth of California
and Washington Territory, and that already
numbers of fishermen are engaged there, and more are
intending to leave.” From all this testimony there can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
be but one conclusion, with regard at least to certain
kinds of fish.</p>

<p>Salmon exists in unequalled numbers, so that this
fish, so aristocratic elsewhere, becomes common. Not
merely the prize of epicures, it is the food of all. Not
merely the pastime of gentle natures, like Izaak Walton
or Sir Humphry Davy, who employ in its pursuit
an elegant leisure, its capture is the daily reward of the
humblest. On Vancouver’s Island it is the constant
ration given out by the Hudson’s Bay Company to the
men in service. At Sitka ships are gratuitously supplied
with it by the natives. By the side of the incalculable
multitudes swarming out of the Arctic waters,
haunting this extended coast, and peopling its rivers,
so that at a single haul Portlock took not less than two
thousand, how small an allowance are the two hundred
thousand which the salmon fisheries of England annually
supply!</p>

<p>Herring seem not less multitudinous than the salmon.
Their name, derived from the German <i>Heer</i>, signifying
an army, is amply verified, as on the coast of
Norway they move in such hosts that a boat at times
makes its way with difficulty through the compact
mass. I do not speak at a venture, for I have received
this incident from a scientific gentleman who witnessed
it on the coast. This fish, less aristocratic than the
salmon, is a universal food, but here it would seem
enough for all.</p>

<p>The halibut, so often mentioned for size and abundance,
is less generally known than the others. It is
common in the fisheries of Norway, Iceland, and Greenland.
In our country its reputation is local. Even at
the seaport of Norfolk, in Virginia, it does not appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
to have been known before 1843, when its arrival was
announced as that of a distinguished stranger: “Our
market yesterday morning was enriched with a delicacy
from the Northern waters, the halibut, a strange
fish in these parts, known only to epicures and naturalists.”
The larger fish are sometimes coarse and far
from delicate, but they furnish a substantial meal, while
the smaller halibut is much liked.</p>

<p>The cod is perhaps the most generally diffused and
abundant of all, for it swims in all the waters of the
coast, from the Frozen Ocean to the southern limit,
sometimes in immense numbers. It is a popular fish,
and, when cured or salted, is an excellent food in all
parts of the world. Palatable, digestible, and nutritious,
the cod, as compared with other fish, is as beef
compared with other meats; so that its incalculable
multitudes seem to be according to a wise economy of
Nature. A female cod is estimated to contain from three
to nine million eggs.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Talk of multiplication a hundred
fold,&mdash;here it is to infinity. Imagine these millions
of eggs grown into fish, and then the process of
reproduction repeated, and you have numbers which,
like astronomical distances, are beyond human conception.
But here the ravenous powers of other fish are
more destructive than any efforts of the fisherman.</p>

<p>Behind all these is the whale, whose corporal dimensions
fitly represent the space he occupies in the fisheries
of the world, hardly diminished by petroleum or
gas. On this extended coast and in all these seas he
is at home. Here is his retreat and play-ground. This
is especially the case with the right-whale, or, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
to whalers, “the <em>right</em> whale to catch,” with bountiful
supply of oil and bone, who is everywhere throughout
this region, appearing at all points and swarming
its waters. D’Wolf says, “We were frequently surrounded
by them.”<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Meares says, “Abundant as the
whales may be in the vicinity of Nootka, they bear no
comparison to the numbers seen on the northern part
of the coast.”<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> At times they are very large. Kotzebue
reports them at Oonalaska of fabulous proportions,
called by the natives <i>Aliamak</i>, and so long “that the
people engaged at the opposite ends of the fish must
halloo very loud to be able to understand each other.”<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
Another whale, known as the bow-head, is so much
about Kadiak that it is sometimes called the Kadiak
whale. The valuable sperm-whale, whose head and
hunch are so productive in spermaceti, belongs to a
milder sea, but he sometimes strays to the Aleutians.
The narwhal, with his long tusk of ivory, out of which
was made the famous throne of the early Danish kings,
belongs to the Frozen Ocean; but he, too, strays into
the straits below. As no sea is now <i>mare clausum</i>,
all these may be pursued by a ship under any flag,
except directly on the coast and within its territorial
limit. And yet the possession of this coast as a commercial
base must necessarily give to its people peculiar
advantages in the pursuit. What is done now
under difficulties will be done then with facilities, such
at least as neighborhood supplied to the natives even
with their small craft.</p>

<p>In our country the whale fishery has been a great
and prosperous commerce, counted by millions. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
yielded considerable gains, and sometimes large fortunes.
The town of New Bedford, one of the most beautiful
in the world, has been enriched by this fishery. And
yet you cannot fail to remark the impediments which
the business has been compelled to overcome. The
ship was fitted on the Atlantic coast for a voyage of
two or three years, and all the crew entered into partnership
with regard to the oil. Traversing two oceans,
separated by a stormy cape, it reaches at last its distant
destination in these northern seas, and commences
its tardy work, interrupted by occasional rest and opportunity
to refit at the Sandwich Islands. This now
will be changed, as the ship sallies forth from friendly
harbors near the game which is its mighty chase.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the whale fishery I turn to another branch
of inquiry. Undoubtedly there are infinite numbers
of fish on the coast; but to determine whether they
can constitute a permanent and profitable fishery, there
are at least three different considerations which must
not be disregarded: (1.) The existence of banks or
soundings; (2.) Proper climatic conditions for catching
and curing fish; (3.) A market.</p>

<p>(1.) The <i>necessity of banks or soundings</i> is according
to reason. Fish are not caught in the deep ocean. It
is their nature to seek the bottom, where they are found
in some way by the fisherman, armed with trawl, seine,
or hook. As among the ancient Romans private luxury
provided tanks and ponds for the preservation of
fish, so Nature provides banks, which are immense fish-preserves.
Soundings attest their existence in a margin
along the coast; but it becomes important to know if
they actually exist to much extent away from the coast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
On this point our information is already considerable, if
not decisive.</p>

<p>The Sea and Strait of Behring, as far as the Frozen
Ocean, have been surveyed by a naval expedition of the
United States under Commander John Rodgers. From
one of his charts, now before me, it appears, that, beginning
at the Frozen Ocean and descending through Behring
Strait and Behring Sea, embracing Kotzebue Sound,
Norton Bay, and Bristol Bay, to the peninsula of Alaska,
a distance of more than twelve degrees, there are
constant uninterrupted soundings from twenty to fifty
fathoms,&mdash;thus presenting an immense extent proper
for fishery. South of the peninsula of Alaska another
chart shows soundings along the coast, with a considerable
extent of bank in the neighborhood of the Shumagins
and Kadiak, being precisely where other evidence
points to the existence of cod. These banks, north and
south of Alaska, taken together, according to indications
of the two charts, have an extent unsurpassed by
any in the world.</p>

<p>There is another illustration full of instruction. It
is a map of the world, in the new work of Murray on
“The Geographical Distribution of Mammals,” “showing
approximately the one hundred fathom line of
soundings,” prepared from information furnished by the
Hydrographic Department of the British Admiralty.
Here are all the soundings of the world. At a glance
you discern the remarkable line on the Pacific coast,
beginning at 40° of north latitude, and constantly receding
from the shore in a northwesterly direction;
then, with a gentle sweep, stretching from Sitka to the
Aleutians, which it envelops with a wide margin; and,
finally, embracing and covering Behring Strait to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Frozen Ocean: the whole space, as indicated on the
map, seeming like an immense unbroken sea-meadow
adjoining the land, and constituting plainly the largest
extent of soundings in length and breadth in the known
world,&mdash;larger even than those of Newfoundland added
to those of Great Britain. This map, prepared by scientific
authority, in the interest of science, is an unimpeachable
and disinterested witness.</p>

<p>Actual experience is better authority still. I learn
that the people of California have already found cod-banks
in these seas, and have begun to gather a harvest.
Distance was no impediment; for they were already
accustomed to the Sea of Okhotsk, on the Asiatic coast.
In 1866 no less than seventeen vessels left San Francisco
for cod-fishery in the latter region. This was a
long voyage, requiring eighty days in going and returning.
On the way better grounds were discovered among
the Aleutians, with better fish; and then again, other
fishing-grounds, better in every way, were discovered
south of Alaska, in the neighborhood of the Shumagins,
with an excellent harbor at hand. Here one vessel
began its work on the 14th of May, and, notwithstanding
stormy weather, finished it on the 24th of July,
having taken 52,000 fish. The largest catch in a single
day was 2,300. The average weight of the fish dried
was three pounds. Old fishermen compared the fish in
quality and method of taking with those of Newfoundland.
Large profits are anticipated. While fish from
the Atlantic side bring at San Francisco not less than
twelve cents a pound, it is supposed that Shumagin
fish at only eight cents a pound will yield a better return
than the coasting-trade. These flattering reports
have arrested the attention of Petermann, the indefatigable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
geographical observer, who recounts them in his
journal.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>From an opposite quarter is other confirmation. Here
is a letter, which I have just received from Charles
Bryant, Esq., at present a member of the Massachusetts
Legislature, but for eighteen years acquainted with these
seas, where he was engaged in the whale fishery. After
mentioning the timber at certain places as a reason for
the acquisition of these possessions, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But the chiefest value&mdash;and this alone is worth more
than the pittance asked for it&mdash;consists in its extensive cod
and halibut fish-grounds. To the eastward of Kadiak, or the
Aleutian Islands, are extensive banks, or shoals, nearly, if
not quite, equal in extent to those of Newfoundland, and
as well stocked with fish. Also west of the Aleutian Islands,
which extend from Alaska southwest half-way to Kamtchatka,
and inclosing that part of land laid down as Bristol Bay,
and west of it, is an extensive area of sea, varying from forty
fathoms in depth to twenty, where I have found the supply
of codfish and halibut unfailing. These islands furnish good
harbors for curing and preparing fish, as well as shelter in
storm.”</p>

</div>

<p>In another letter Mr. Bryant says that the shoals east
of the entrance to Cook’s Inlet widen as they extend
southward to latitude 50°; and that there are also large
shoals south of Prince William Sound, and again off
Cross Sound and Sitka. The retired ship-master adds,
that he never examined these shoals to ascertain their
exact limit, but only incidentally, in the course of his
regular business, that he might know when and where
to obtain fish, if he wished them. His report goes beyond
any chart of soundings I have seen, although, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
far as they go, the charts are coincident. Cook particularly
notices soundings in Bristol Bay, and in various
places along the coast. Other navigators have done the
same. Careful surveys have accomplished so much that
at this time the bottom of Behring Sea and of Behring
Strait, as far as the Frozen Ocean, constituting one immense
bank, is completely known in depth and character.</p>

<p>Add to all this the official report of Mr. Giddings, acting
surveyor-general of Washington Territory, made to
the Secretary of the Interior in 1865, where he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Along the coast, between Cape Flattery and Sitka, in
the Russian possessions, both cod and halibut are very plenty,
and of a much larger size than those taken at the Cape, or
further up the Straits and Sound. No one, who knows these
facts, for a moment doubts but that, if vessels similar to those
used by the Bank fishermen that sail from Massachusetts and
Maine were fitted out here, and were to fish on <em>the various
banks along this coast</em>, it would even now be a most lucrative
business.… The cod and halibut on this coast, up near
Sitka, are fully equal to the largest taken in the Eastern
waters.”<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

</div>

<p>From this concurring evidence, including charts and
personal experience, it is easy to see that the first condition
of a considerable fishery is not wanting.</p>

<p>(2.) <i>Climatic conditions</i> must exist also. The proverbial
hardihood of fishermen has limits. Elsewhere
weather and storm have compelled the abandonment of
banks which promised to be profitable. On a portion
of this coast there can be no such rigors. South of
Alaska and the Aleutians, and also in Bristol Bay, immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
to the north of the peninsula of Alaska, the
fishing-grounds will compare in temperature with those
of Newfoundland or Norway. It is more important to
know if the fish, when taken, can be properly cured.
This is one of the privileges of northern skies. Within
the tropics fish may be taken in abundance, but the
constant sun does not allow their preservation. The
constant rains of Sitka, with only a few bright days
in the year, must prevent the work of curing on any
considerable scale. But the navigators make frequent
mention of dry or preserved fish on the coast, and it is
understood that fish are now cured at Kadiak. “Dried
fish” from this island is described by D’Wolf.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> For a
long time it was customary there to dry seal flesh in
the air, which could not be done on the main-land.
Thus the opportunity of curing the fish seems to exist
near the very banks where they are taken, or Fuca
Straits may be a “half-way house” for this purpose.
The California fishermen carry their fish home to be
cured, in which they imitate the fishermen of Gloucester.
As the yearly fishing product of this port is larger
than that of any other in North America, perhaps in
the world, this example cannot be without weight.</p>

<p>(3.) The <i>market</i> also is of prime necessity. Fish are
not caught and cured except for a market. Besides
the extended coast, where an immediate demand must
always prevail in proportion to increasing population,
there is an existing market in California, amply attested
by long voyages to Kamtchatka for fish, and by recent
attempts to find fishing-grounds. San Francisco at one
time took from Okhotsk nine hundred tons of fish, being
about one eighth of the yearly fishing product of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Gloucester. Her fishing-vessels last year brought home
from all quarters fifteen hundred tons of dried fish and
ten thousand gallons of cod-liver oil. There is also
a growing market in Washington and Oregon. But
beyond the domestic market, spreading from the coast
into the interior, there will be a foreign market of no
limited amount. Mexico, Central America, and the
States of South America, all Catholic in religion, will
require this subsistence, and, being southern in climate,
they must look northward for a supply. The two best
customers of our Atlantic fisheries are Hayti and Cuba,
Catholic countries under a southern sun. The fishermen
of Massachusetts began at an early day to send
cod to Portugal, Spain, and Italy, all Catholic countries
under a southern sun. Our “salt fish” became popular.
The Portuguese minister at London in 1785, in a conference
with Mr. Adams on a commercial treaty with
the United States, mentioned “salt fish” among the
objects most needed in his country, and added, that
“the consumption of this article in Portugal was immense,
and he would avow that the American salt fish
was preferred to any other, on account of its quality.”<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
Such facts are more than curious.</p>

<p>But more important than the Pacific States of the
American continent are the great empires of Japan and
China, with uncounted populations depending much on
fish. In China one tenth subsist on fish. Notwithstanding
the considerable supplies at home, it does not
seem impossible for an energetic and commercial people
to find a market here of inconceivable magnitude,
dwarfing the original fur-trade with China, once so
tempting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>From this survey you can all judge the question of
the fisheries, which I only state, without assuming to
determine. You can judge if well-stocked fishing-banks
have been found under such conditions of climate and
market as to supply a new and important fishery. Already
the people of California have anticipated the
answer, and their enterprise has arrested attention in
Europe. The journal of Petermann, the “Geographische
Mittheilungen,” for the present year, which is the authentic
German record of geographical science, borrows
from a San Francisco paper to announce these successful
voyages as the beginning of a new commerce. If
this be so, as there is reason to believe, these coasts
and seas will have unprecedented value. The future
only can disclose the form they may take. They may
be a Newfoundland, a Norway, a Scotland, or perhaps
a New England, with another Gloucester and another
New Bedford.</p>

<h4>INFLUENCE OF FISHERIES.</h4>

<p>An eminent French writer, an enthusiast on fishes,
Lacepède, has depicted the influence of fisheries, which
he illustrates by the herring, calling it “one of those
natural products whose use decides the destiny of empires.”<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
Without adopting these strong words, it is
easy to see that such fisheries as seem about to be
opened on the Pacific must exercise a wonderful influence
over the population there, while they give a new
spring to commerce, and enlarge the national resources.
In these aspects it is impossible to exaggerate. Fishermen
are not as other men. They have a character
of their own, taking complexion from their life. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
ancient Rome they had a peculiar holiday, with games,
known as <i>Piscatorii Ludi</i>. The first among us in this
pursuit were the Pilgrims, who, even before they left
Leyden, looked to fishing for support in their new home,
giving occasion to the remark of King James: “So God
have my soul, ’tis an honest trade; ’twas the Apostles’
own calling.”<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> As soon as they reached Plymouth they
began to fish, and afterwards appropriated the profits
of the fisheries at Cape Cod to found a free school.
From this Pilgrim origin are derived those fisheries
which for a while were our chief commerce, and still
continue an important element of national wealth. The
cod fisheries of the United States are now valued at
more than two million dollars annually. Such an interest
must be felt far and near, commercially and financially,
while it contributes to the comfort of all. How
soon it may prevail on the Pacific who can say? But
this treaty is the beginning.</p>

<p>It is difficult to estimate what is so uncertain, or at
least is prospective only. Our own fisheries, now so
considerable, were small in the beginning; they were
small, even when they inspired the eloquence of Burke,
in that most splendid page never equalled even by himself.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
But the Continental Congress, in its original instructions
to its commissioners for the negotiation of
treaties of peace and commerce with Great Britain, required,
as a fundamental condition, next to independence,
that these fisheries should be preserved unimpaired.
While the proposition was under discussion,
Elbridge Gerry, who had grown up among the fishermen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of Massachusetts, repelled the attack upon their
pursuit in words which are not out of place here. “It
is not so much fishing,” he said, “as enterprise, industry,
and employment. It is not fish merely; it is gold,
the produce of that avocation. It is the employment
of those who would otherwise be idle, the food of those
who would otherwise be hungry, the wealth of those
who would otherwise be poor.”<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> After debate, it was
resolved by Congress that “the common right of fishing
should in no case be given up.”<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> For this principle
the eldest Adams contended with ability and constancy
until it was fixed in the treaty of peace, where
it stands side by side with the acknowledgment of independence.</p>

<p>In the discussions which ended thus triumphantly,
the argument for the fisheries was stated most compactly
by Ralph Izard, of South Carolina, in a letter
to John Adams, dated at Paris, 24th September, 1778;
and this early voice from South Carolina may be repeated
now.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Since the advantages of commerce have been well understood,
the fisheries have been looked upon by the naval
powers of Europe as an object of the greatest importance.
The French have been increasing their fishery ever since the
Treaty of Utrecht, which has enabled them to rival Great
Britain at sea. The fisheries of Holland were not only the
first rise of the Republic, but have been the constant support
of all her commerce and navigation. This branch of
trade is of such concern to the Dutch that in their public
prayers they are said to request the Supreme Being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> ‘that it
would please Him to bless the Government, the Lords, the
States, and also their fisheries.’ The fishery of Newfoundland
appears to me to be a mine of infinitely greater value than
Mexico and Peru. It enriches the proprietors, is worked at
less expense, and is the source of naval strength and protection.”<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Captain Smith, the adventurous founder and deliverer
of the colony of Virginia, when appealing to Englishmen
at home in behalf of the feeble New England settlements,
especially dwells upon the fisheries. “Therefore,”
he concludes, “honourable and worthy Country
men, let not the meannesse of the word fish distaste
you, for it will afford as good gold as the Mines of
<i>Guiana</i> or <i>Potassie</i>, with lesse hazard and charge, and
more certainty and facility.”<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Doubtless for a long
time the neighboring fish-banks were the gold-mines of
New England.</p>

<p>I have grouped these allusions that you may see
how the fisheries of that day, though comparatively
small, enlisted the energies of our fathers. Tradition
confirms the record. The sculptured image of a cod
pendent from the ceiling in the hall of the Massachusetts
House of Representatives, where it was placed
during the last century, constantly recalls this industrial
and commercial staple, with the great part it performed.
And now it is my duty to remind you that
these fisheries, guarded so watchfully and vindicated
with such conquering zeal, had a value prospective
rather than present, or at least small compared with
what it is now. Exact figures, covering the ten years
between 1765 and 1775, show that during this period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Massachusetts employed annually in the fisheries 665
vessels, measuring 25,630 tons, with only 4,405 men.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
In contrast with this interest, which seems so small,
although at the time considerable, are the present fisheries
of our country; and here again we have exact
figures. The number of vessels in the cod fishery alone,
in 1861, just before the blight of war reached this business,
was 2,753, measuring 137,665 tons, with 19,271
men,&mdash;being more than four times as many vessels
and men, and more than five times as much tonnage,
as for ten years preceding the Revolution were employed
annually by Massachusetts, representing at that
time the fishing interest of the country.</p>

<p>Small beginnings, therefore, are no discouragement;
I turn with confidence to the future. Already the local
fisheries on this coast have developed among the
generations of natives a singular gift in building and
managing their small craft so as to excite the frequent
admiration of voyagers. The larger fisheries there will
naturally exercise a corresponding influence on the population
destined to build and manage the larger craft.
The beautiful baidar will give way to the fishing-smack,
the clipper, and the steamer. All things will be changed
in form and proportion; but the original aptitude for
the sea will remain. A practical race of intrepid navigators
will swarm the coast, ready for any enterprise
of business or patriotism. Commerce will find new
arms, the country new defenders, the national flag new
hands to bear it aloft.</p>

<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I now conclude this examination.
From a review of the origin of the treaty, and the general
considerations with regard to it, we have passed
to an examination of these possessions under different
heads, in order to arrive at a knowledge of their character
and value. And here we have noticed the existing
government, which was found to be nothing but a
fur company, whose only object is trade; then the population,
where a very few Russians and Creoles are a
scanty fringe to the aboriginal races; then the climate,
a ruling influence, with its thermal current of ocean
and its eccentric isothermal line, by which the rigors
of the coast are tempered to a mildness unknown in
the same latitude on the Atlantic side; then the vegetable
products, so far as observed, chief among which
are forests of pine and fir waiting for the axe; then
the mineral products, among which are coal and copper,
if not iron, silver, lead, and gold, besides the two great
products of New England, “granite and ice”; then the
furs, including precious skins of the black fox and sea-otter,
which originally tempted the settlement, and remain
to this day the exclusive object of pursuit; and,
lastly, the fisheries, which, in waters superabundant
with animal life beyond any of the globe, seem to
promise a new commerce. All these I have presented
plainly and impartially, exhibiting my authorities as
I proceeded. I have done little more than hold the
scales. If these incline on either side, it is because
reason or testimony on that side is the weightier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<h4>WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE.</h4>

<p>As these extensive possessions, constituting a corner
of the continent, pass from the imperial government of
Russia, they will naturally receive a new name. They
will be no longer Russian America. How shall they be
called? Clearly, any name borrowed from classical
antiquity or from individual invention will be little
better than misnomer or nickname unworthy of the
historic occasion. Even if taken from our own annals,
it will be of doubtful taste. The name should
come from the country itself. It should be indigenous,
aboriginal, one of the autochthons of the soil.
Happily such a name exists, as proper in sound as in
origin. It appears from the report of Cook, the illustrious
navigator, to whom I have so often referred,
that the euphonious designation now applied to the
peninsula which is the continental link of the Aleutian
chain was the sole word used originally by the native
islanders, “when speaking of the American continent
in general, which they knew perfectly well to be a
great land.”<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> It only remains, that, following these
natives, whose places are now ours, we, too, should call
this “great land” Alaska.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>Another change should be made. As the settlements
of this coast came eastward from Russia, bringing with
the Russian flag Western time, the day is earlier by
twenty-four hours with them than with us, so that their
Sunday is our Saturday, and the other days of the week
are in corresponding discord. This must be rectified
according to the national meridian, so that there shall
be the same Sunday for all, and the other days of the
week shall be in corresponding harmony. Important
changes must follow, of which this is typical. All else
must be rectified according to the national meridian, so
that within the sphere of our common country there
shall be everywhere the same generous rule and one
prevailing harmony. Of course, the unreformed Julian
calendar, received from Russia, will give place to ours,&mdash;Old
Style yielding to New Style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>An object of immediate practical interest will be the
survey of the extended and indented coast by our own
officers, bringing it all within the domain of science, and
assuring to navigation much-needed assistance, while
the Republic is honored by a continuation of national
charts, where execution vies with science, and the art of
engraving is the beautiful handmaid. Associated with
this survey, and scarcely inferior in value, will be the
examination of the country by scientific explorers, so
that its geological structure may become known, with
its various products, vegetable and mineral. But your
best work and most important endowment will be the
Republican Government, which, looking to a long future,
you will organize, with schools free to all, and
with equal laws, before which every citizen will stand
erect in the consciousness of manhood. Here will be
a motive power without which coal itself is insufficient.
Here will be a source of wealth more inexhaustible
than any fisheries. Bestow such a government, and
you will give what is better than all you can receive,
whether quintals of fish, sands of gold, choicest fur, or
most beautiful ivory.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner moved the following resolution, and asked its immediate
consideration:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the President of the United States be requested to
furnish to the Senate, if in his opinion not incompatible with the public
interests, copies of any official opinions which may have been given
by the Attorney-General, the Solicitor of the Treasury, or by any other
officer of the Government, on the interpretation of the Act of Congress
regulating the tenure of offices, and especially with regard to appointments
by the President during the recess of Congress.”</p>

</div>

<p>There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.
Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Before the vote is taken, allow me to make a statement.
I understand that opinions have been given
by one or more officers of the Government which go far
to nullify a recent Act of Congress. In short, it seems
as if we are to have Nullification here in Washington in
the Executive branch of the Government. According to
these opinions, the President, I understand, is to exercise
a power of appointment during the recess of Congress,
notwithstanding the recent Act which undertakes
to regulate the tenure of office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>We all know the astuteness of lawyers. It is a proverb.
And it is sometimes said that a lawyer may drive
a coach-and-six through an Act of Parliament, or even
an Act of Congress. The Administration is now about
to drive its coach-and-six through our recent legislation.
In other words, it is about to force upon the country
officers who cannot be officers according to existing law.
It seems to me, that, before we adjourn, we should
know the precise state of this question. We should
understand if any such opinion has been given, and
the reasons for it. It is on this account that I have
introduced the resolution now before the Senate.</p>

<p>On the day after the adjournment of Congress the Senate was convened
for the transaction of Executive business. Treaties and nominations
were laid before it.</p>

<p>April 11th, on motion of Mr. Williams, of Oregon, the Senate considered
a resolution for adjournment <i>sine die</i> “the 13th instant.” Debate
ensued. Mr. Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland, said: “We can fix
the adjournment to-morrow or next day.” Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois,
said: “Let us fix it to-day.” Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I do not think we can fix it to-day, and, further, I
do not think we ought to fix it to-day. It seems
to me the calendar should be cleared before we talk
of going home.</p>

<p>A Senator exclaims, “Wait until we get through.”
So I say. Senators are perfectly aware, that, owing to
an interpretation recently put by the Executive upon
the Tenure-of-Office Bill, there is an increased necessity
for our staying. We have passed a law. We should
see to its enforcement. At any rate, we should manifest
coöperation with the Executive, so that there shall
be no excuse for setting it aside. I do not admit that
he can in any way set it aside; but I wish to do
everything that can be done to prevent him from undertaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
to set it aside. We ought to stay until our
work is fully done. There can be no excuse for going
home while any part of the Executive business remains
unfinished. Other Congresses have stayed here till midsummer,
and even into the month of September. If the
necessities of the country require it, I see no reason
why we should not stay till then.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>April 12th, the subject was resumed, when Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I will say, that, just in proportion as we draw to
the close of our business, we shall be better prepared
to determine when we can adjourn finally. As we have
not drawn to the close, I submit we are not in a condition
to fix the day. That time may come; but I
may remind the Senate that there is in Executive session
unfinished business beyond what we had reason
to expect. I say “reason to expect,” because it is well
known that there are many offices still unfilled; and it
is our duty, before we leave, so far as it depends upon
us, to see that they are filled.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>We should stay, it seems to me, until the offices are
filled, rejecting nominations that are bad and confirming
the good,&mdash;doing, in short, all we can, as a Senate,
to secure good officers, and I insist, also, officers on the
right side, who agree with Congress, and will sustain
the policy which Congress has declared.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The resolution was amended so as to make the adjournment 16th
April, and then adopted,&mdash;Yeas 26, Nays 11,&mdash;Mr. Sumner voting
in the negative. The time was afterwards extended, on motion of Mr.
Sumner, to 20th April, when the Senate adjourned without day.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;You wish to have the North
“reconstructed,” so at least that it shall cease to
deny the elective franchise on account of color. But
you postpone the day by insisting on the preliminary
of a Constitutional Amendment. I know your vows
to the good cause; but I ask you to make haste. We
cannot wait.</p>

<p>Of course, we can always wait for the needful processes;
but there are present reasons why we should
allow no time to be lost. <em>This question must be settled
forthwith</em>: in other words, it must be settled before
the Presidential election, now at hand. Our colored
fellow-citizens at the South are already electors. They
will vote at the Presidential election. But why should
they vote at the South, and not at the North? The
rule of justice is the same for both. Their votes are
needed at the North as well as the South. There are
Northern States where their votes can make the good
cause safe beyond question. There are other States
where their votes will be like the last preponderant
weight in the nicely balanced scales. Let our colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
fellow-citizens vote in Maryland, and that State, now
so severely tried, will be fixed for Human Rights forever.
Let them vote in Pennsylvania, and you will
give more than twenty thousand votes to the Republican
cause. Let them vote in New York, and the
scales, which hang so doubtful, will incline to the Republican
side. It will be the same in Connecticut.
I mention these by way of example. But everywhere
the old Proslavery party will kick the beam. Let all
this be done, I say, before the next Presidential election.</p>

<p>Among the proposed ways is a new Constitutional
Amendment. But this is too dilatory. It cannot become
operative till after the Presidential election. Besides,
it is needless. Instead of amending the Constitution,
read it.</p>

<p>Another way is by moving each State, and obtaining
through local legislation what is essentially <em>a right
of citizenship</em>. But this again is too dilatory, while it
turns each State into a political maelström, and submits
a question of <em>National</em> interest to the chances of
local controversy and the timidity of local politicians.
This will not do. Emancipation was a National act,
proceeding from the National Government, and applicable
to all the States. Enfranchisement, which is the
corollary and complement of Emancipation, must be
a National act also, proceeding from the National Government,
and applicable to all the States. If left to
the States individually, the result, besides being tardy,
will be uncertain and fragmentary.</p>

<p>There is another way, at once prompt, energetic, and
comprehensive. It is by Act of Congress, adopted by
a majority of two thirds, in spite of Presidential veto.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
The time has passed when this power can be questioned.
Congress has already exercised it in the Rebel
States. I do not forget its hesitations. Only a year
ago, when I insisted that it must do so, and introduced
a bill to this effect, I was answered that a Constitutional
Amendment was needed, and I was voted down.
A change came, and in a happy moment Congress exercised
the power. What patriot questions it now?
But the power is unquestionable in the other States
also. It concerns the rights of citizenship, and this
subject is as essentially national as the army or the
navy.</p>

<p>Even without either of the recent Constitutional
Amendments, I am at a loss to understand how a denial
of the elective franchise simply on account of
color can be otherwise than unconstitutional. I cannot
see how, under a National Constitution which does
not contain the word “white” or “black,” there can
be any exclusion on account of color. There is no
such exclusion in the Constitution. Out of what text
is this oligarchical pretension derived? But, putting
aside this question, which will be clearer to the jurists
of the next generation than to us, I vouch the authoritative
words of the National Constitution, making it
our duty to guaranty a republican form of government
in the States. Now the greatest victory of the war,
to which all other victories, whether in Congress or
on the bloody field, were only tributary, was the definition
of a republican government according to the
principles of the Declaration of Independence. A government
which denies the elective franchise on account
of color, or, in other words, sets up any “qualifications”
of voters in their nature insurmountable, cannot be republican;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
for the first principle in a republican government
is Equality of Rights, according to the principles
of the Declaration of Independence. And this definition,
I insist, is the crowning glory of the war which
beat down Rebellion under its feet. It only remains
for Congress to enforce it by appropriate legislation.</p>

<p>There are two recent Constitutional Amendments, each
of which furnishes ample and cumulative power.</p>

<p>There is, first, the Amendment abolishing Slavery,
with its clause conferring on Congress the power to
enforce it by appropriate legislation, in pursuance of
which Congress has already passed the Civil Rights
Act, which is applicable to the North as well as the
South. Clearly, and most obviously beyond all question,
if it can pass a Civil Rights Act, it can also pass
a Political Rights Act; for each is appropriate to enforce
the abolition of Slavery, and to complete this
work. Without it the work is only half done.</p>

<p>There is yet another Amendment, recently adopted by
three fourths of the loyal States, which is itself an abundant
source of power. After declaring that all persons
born or naturalized in the United States and subject to
the jurisdiction thereof are “citizens,” this Amendment
proceeds to provide that “no State shall make or enforce
any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities
of <em>citizens</em> of the United States”; and Congress
is empowered to enforce this provision by appropriate
legislation. Nothing can be plainer than this.</p>

<p>Here, then, are three different sources of power in
the Constitution itself, each sufficient, the three together
three times sufficient,&mdash;each exuberant and overflowing,
the three together three times exuberant and
overflowing. How, in the face of these provisions, any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
person can doubt the power of Congress I cannot understand.
But, alas! there are doubters always.</p>

<p>I have already sent you a copy of my bill to settle
this question by what I call “the short cut.” Give us
your vote. Of course, you will. Believe me, my dear
Sir,</p>

<p class="sig">Very faithfully yours,</p>

<p>This was followed by an editorial article sustaining and vindicating
Mr. Sumner’s bill. It began:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Yes. Mr. Sumner has our vote. He has always had it; he is always
likely to have it. ‘How did Roger Sherman vote?’ asked our forefathers.
They believed it was safe to vote with Roger Sherman. It is just as safe
to vote with Charles Sumner.”</p>

</div>

<p>After explanation and argument, the article proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Not only is Mr. Sumner right as to the power of Congress in the present
case, but long ago he was right as to the power of Congress to govern
the unconstitutional States as conquered provinces. He then stood almost
alone in the Senate in an opinion which he has since seen adopted by his
brother Senators. We trust his compeers will agree to his present bill.
We happen to know that Thaddeus Stevens&mdash;who, even when sick, is
more well than most men&mdash;is preparing, on his sick-bed, an argument in
support of Mr. Sumner’s plan. We happen to know, also, that Chief Justice
Chase agrees with Mr. Sumner’s view.”</p>

ITS NEW NAME.</h2>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>West Cambridge, originally part of Cambridge, Massachusetts, assumed
the name of Arlington, with the consent of the Legislature.
The change was celebrated in the town by a public dinner in a tent.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Mr. President and Fellow-Citizens of Arlington</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">In looking around me on this beautiful scene of hospitality,
I am reminded of that doge of Genoa, who,
finding himself amid the splendors of Versailles, in its
incomparable palace, and being asked what about him
caused the most surprise, replied, “To find myself here.”
And so to me, coming from other scenes, and for many
years absolutely unused to such occasions, this spectacle
is strange. But it is not less welcome because
strange.</p>

<p>Coming here to take part in this interesting celebration,
I am not insensible to the kindness of good
friends among you, through whom the invitation was
received. But I confess a neighborly interest in your
festival. Born in Boston, and educated in Cambridge,
I am one of your neighbors. Accept, then, if you please,
the sympathies of a neighbor on this occasion.</p>

<p>Yours is not a large town; nor has it any extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
history. But what it wants in size and history it
makes up in beauty. Yours is a beautiful town. I
know nothing among the exquisite surroundings of
Boston more charming than these slopes and meadows,
with background of hills and gleam of water. The elements
of beauty are all here. Hills are always beautiful;
so is water. I remember hearing a woman of
genius, Mrs. Fanny Kemble, say more than once, that
water in a landscape is “like eyes in the human countenance,”
without which the countenance is lifeless.
But water gleams, shines, sparkles in your landscape.
Here the water-nymphs might find a home. Gardens,
beautiful to the eye and bountiful in nourishing and
luscious supplies, are also yours. Surely it may be said
of those who live here, that their lines have fallen in
a pleasant place.</p>

<p>I go too far, when I suggest that you are without
a history. West Cambridge was part of that historic
Cambridge so early famous in our country, the seat of
learning and the home of patriotism. The honor of
Cambridge is yours. West Cambridge adjoins Lexington,
and was in the war-path of the British soldiers
on that 19th of April, which, perhaps, as much as any
day after the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers, determined
the fortunes of this continent. The shots of
Concord and Lexington were heard here before their
echoes began the tour of the globe. Shots from here
followed, and your beautiful fields bore testimony in
blood. The road from Concord was a prolonged battleground,
on which British troops fell; there were patriots,
also, who fell.</p>

<p>Then came the Battle of Bunker Hill, on the very
day we now celebrate, followed soon by the arrival of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Washington, who, on the 3d day of July, 1775, drew his
sword as Commander-in-Chief under the well-known
elm of Cambridge Common. Do not forget that you
were of Cambridge then. The first duty of the new
commander-in-chief was to inspect his forces. The mass
of the British army, amounting to 11,500 men, occupied
Bunker Hill and Boston Neck, while their general
with his light horse was in Boston. The Patriot forces,
amounting to about 16,000 men, were so posted as to
form a complete line around Boston and Charlestown,
from Mystic River to Dorchester, nearly twelve miles
in circuit. Regiments from New Hampshire, Rhode
Island, and Connecticut occupied Winter Hill and Prospect
Hill, where it is easy still to recognize their earthworks;
several of the Massachusetts regiments were at
Cambridge; and others from Connecticut and Massachusetts
covered the high grounds of Roxbury. This was
the Siege of Boston. With all these preparations, Washington
was still provident of the future. And here commences
an association with the hills about your town,
which must be my justification for these details.</p>

<p>Many years ago, when I first read the account of
this period by one of the early biographers of Washington,
Rev. Dr. Bancroft, of Worcester, the father of our
distinguished historian, I was struck by the statement,
which I quote in his precise words, that, “in case of an
attack and defeat, the <em>Welsh Mountains in Cambridge</em>,
and the rear of the lines in Roxbury, were appointed
as places of rendezvous.”<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Perhaps this association, and
even the name of the mountains, may be new to some
whom I have the honor of addressing. “The Welsh
Mountains” are the hills which skirt your peaceful valley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Since then I have never looked upon them, even
at a distance, I have never thought of them, without
feeling that they are monumental. They testify to that
perfect prudence which made our commander-in-chief
so great. In those hours when undisciplined patriots
were preparing for conflict with the trained soldiers of
England, the careful eye of Washington, calmly surveying
the whole horizon, selected your hills as the breastworks
behind which he was to retrieve the day. The
hills still stand firm and everlasting as when he looked
upon them, but smiling now with fertility and peace.
They will never be needed as breastworks. There is
no enemy encamped in Boston and ready to sally forth
for battle; nor is there any siege.</p>

<p>But you will allow me to remind you that the ideas
of the Revolution and the solemn promises of the Declaration
of Independence are still debated. There are
some who have the hardihood to deny them. Here I
venture to bespeak from you the simple loyalty of those
whose places you occupy. Should an evil hour arrive,
when these ideas and promises are in peril, then let
them find a breastwork, not in your hills, but in your
hearts. And may the rally extend until it embraces
the whole country, and the Revolution begun by our
fathers is completed by the establishment of all the
rights of all!</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>July 3d, according to the provision in the resolution of adjournment
at the last session, Congress met at noon this day. The Chief
Clerk read the resolution.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Mr. Sumner then said that he rose to
a question of order on the resolution.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The resolution under which Congress is to-day assembled,
so far as it undertakes to direct the adjournment
of the two Houses of Congress without day,
in the absence of a quorum of the two Houses, is unconstitutional
and inoperative, inasmuch as the Constitution,
after declaring that “a majority of each House
shall constitute a quorum to do business,” proceeds to
provide that “a smaller number may adjourn from day
to day, and may be authorized to compel the attendance
of absent members”; and therefore such resolution
must not be regarded by the Chair, so far as
it undertakes to provide for an adjournment without
day.</p>

<p>As, according to the view, there is a quorum already
present, the incident contemplated by the resolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
will not arise; but I felt it my duty, by way of precaution
and <i>caveat</i>, to introduce this protest, to the
end that the resolution may not hereafter be drawn
into a precedent so as to abridge the rights of the
two Houses of Congress under the Constitution of the
United States.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, differed from Mr. Sumner, and entered
his “protest against any such construction of the Constitution as
denies to the two Houses of Congress the right to regulate their
own adjournments.” After quoting the text of the Constitution, that
“a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business, but a
smaller number may adjourn from day to day and may be authorized
to compel the attendance of absent members,” Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Here is a concurrent resolution providing for a future
meeting of Congress. To that extent it is unquestionably
constitutional; but when the resolution
imposes shackles upon the two Houses of Congress
assembled by virtue of that resolution, then, I submit,
it does what, under the National Constitution, it
cannot do,&mdash;its words are powerless. Congress, when
once assembled by virtue of that resolution, has all
the powers of a Congress of the United States under
the Constitution. That resolution cannot restrain it.
Such, at any rate, is my conclusion, after the best reflection
that I have been able to give to these words
of the Constitution; and I feel it my duty to make
this protest, to the end that what we now do may
not be drawn into an example hereafter. It is well
known that those words were introduced in order to
tie the hands of Congress, should it come together
and there be no quorum present,&mdash;in short, to despoil
the Congress then assembled of the prerogative
secured to it by the National Constitution. To that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
extent I suggest that the resolution hereafter shall be
regarded as of no value, and not be quoted as a precedent.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner had looked to this session not only for precautions
against the President, but for legislation on Suffrage. He had never
doubted that there would be a session. March 30th, just before the
final adjournment, he gave notice that on the first Wednesday of July
he should ask the Senate to proceed with his bill to secure the elective
franchise to colored citizens, when Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, said,
“The Senator had better add, ‘or some subsequent day.’” [<i>Laughter.</i>]
Mr. Sumner said: “I beg the Senate to take notice that there will
be a session on the first Wednesday of July, to proceed with business.
I have reason to believe that there will be a quorum here, for there
will be important public business that must be attended to.”</p>

<p>On the completion of the organization, Mr. Sumner proceeded to
offer petitions, when he was interrupted by Mr. Fessenden, of Maine,
who said: “I desire to interpose an objection to the reference of these
petitions; and I may as well bring the question up here now, before
the Senator offers any more. I do it for the reason that in my judgment
it is not expedient at the present session to act upon general
business”; and he referred to the course at the session of the Twenty-Seventh
Congress, called by President Harrison. Mr. Sumner said, in
reply:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;We are a Congress of the United
States, assembled under the National Constitution,
and with all the powers belonging to Congress,&mdash;ay,
Sir, and with all the responsibilities also. We cannot,
by agreement or understanding, divest ourselves of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
responsibilities, being nothing less than to transact the
public business,&mdash;not simply one item or two items,
but the public business in its sum total, whatever it may
be,&mdash;in one word, all that concerns the welfare of this
great Republic. Now the Senator limits us to one item,
which he has only alluded to, without characterizing. I
suppose I understand him; but he must know well that
even that business has many ramifications. But why
are we to be restricted thus? Looking at past usage,
I need not remind you that we have habitually sat
throughout the summer into the month of August, and
on one occasion into the month of September. It is no
new thing that Congress should be here in July. It is
an exception that Congress is not here in July, during
every alternate year. Therefore, in considering public
business, even under these heats, we are only doing
what our predecessors before us have done; we are following
the usage of Congress, and not setting up a new
usage of our own. The motion of the Senator, if it be
a motion, or rather his suggestion, does set up a new
usage. It is virtually to declare, that, when admonished
by the heats of July, we will fold our hands, and will
not even consider public business, except in one particular
case; that all the other vast interests of this country
will be left, without reference to a committee, without
inquiry, unattended to, neglected.</p>

<p>The Senator from Maine says, that, when Congress
adjourned at the end of March, it was not supposed that
there would be a session at this time. He may not have
supposed there would be a session. I never doubted
that there would be one. I saw full well that the
public interests would require a session in July, and I
labored to bring it about, feeling that in so doing I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
only discharging a public duty. Do you forget whom
you have as President? A constant disturber, and a
mischief-maker. So long as his administration continues,
it is the duty of Congress to be on guard, perpetually
on watch against him; and this must have been
obvious when Congress adjourned, as it is obvious now.
Senators may not have foreseen precisely what he would
do; but I take it that there were few who did not foresee
that he would do something making it important for
Congress to be present. I did not doubt, then, that it
would be our duty to be here in our places to make
adequate provision against his misdeeds. He is President,
and the head of the Executive, invested with all
the powers belonging to that department. It is hard, I
know, to provide against him; but nevertheless you
must do it. This Republic is too great, too vast, and too
precious, to be left in the hands of a bad man.</p>

<p>One of the greatest masters in the art of war tells us,
as the lesson of his great military experience, that the
good general always regards that as probable which
is possible. I know no better rule for the statesman.
Now, with a President such as we have, anything in the
nature of disturbance or interference with the public security
is possible through the Executive arm. Therefore
you are to regard it as probable, and make provision
against it. So I argued last spring, and was satisfied
that it would be our duty to be in our seats at the
coming July. We are here, and I now insist that it
is our duty to go forward and discharge all our duties,
without exception, under the National Constitution.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Fessenden replied, referring to the proceedings at the called
session of the Twenty-Seventh Congress on resolutions of Mr. Clay to
limit business. Mr. Sumner rejoined:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope the Senate will pardon me, if I add one word
to what I have already said. The Senator from Maine
introduces as a precedent something which he will pardon
me if I say is not a precedent. He calls our attention
to a session of Congress convened by virtue
of a summons of the President, being a called session.
Why, Sir, this is no called session. This is simply a
continuing session, begun on the 4th day of March. It
is not a new session. It is a session already begun, prolonged
by adjournment into the midst of July. Were
it such a session as the Senator from Maine seems to
imagine, his precedent might be applicable. We might
then search the message of the President to find the
subjects proper for consideration. It is, however, no
such session. We are here broadly, under all our powers
as a Congress, our life as a Congress having begun
here on the 4th day of March at noon. Therefore, allow
me to say, the precedent is inapplicable.</p>

<p>The practical question, then, is, What shall we do,
being a Congress assembled as any other Congress, with
all powers and all duties? I submit, proceed with the
public business in due order, until such time as by the
reports of committees or by votes of the two bodies we
shall be satisfied that it is not advisable to proceed further.
I think, therefore, petitions should be presented
and referred, bills introduced and take their proper destinations,
and business of all kinds be brought before
the Senate.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>At the suggestion of Senators, the petitions were laid on the table to
await formal action on the question.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>July 5th, Mr. Anthony, of Rhode Island, moved the following resolution,
which had been agreed upon in a caucus of Republican Senators:&mdash;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the legislative business of this session be confined to
removing the obstructions which have been or are likely to be placed in
the way of the fair execution of the Acts of Reconstruction heretofore
adopted by Congress, and to giving to said Acts the scope intended by
Congress when the same were passed; and that further legislation, at this
session, on the subject of Reconstruction, or on other subjects, is not expedient.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner at once appealed to Mr. Anthony:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Before a resolution of such importance, so open to
criticism, so doubtful in point of order, so plainly contrary
to the spirit of the Constitution, is brought under
consideration, I do think that the Senator who brings it
forward should enlighten us in regard to its object, and
the reasons in justification of so extraordinary a proposition.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Anthony made a brief statement, in which he said that he
“supposed the reason for this proposition was so evident to every
Senator who has conversed with the members of the body, that it
would require no explanation whatever”; that “the public sentiment
of the country demanded that there should be some legislation in order
to make the Reconstruction Acts precisely what we intended them to
be, and not as they have been construed.” Mr. Sumner then moved
the following substitute:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the Senate will proceed, under its rules, to the despatch of the
public business requiring attention, and to this end all petitions and bills
will be referred for consideration to the appropriate committees, without
undertaking in advance to limit the action of Congress to any special subject,
and to deny a hearing on all other subjects.”</p>

</div>

<p>He then remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I object to the proposition of my friend from Rhode
Island, which I cannot but think he has introduced
hastily and without sufficient consideration, or at any
rate under influences which I think his own better
judgment should have rejected. I am against it on
several grounds. If I said it was contrary to precedent,
I should not err; for the attempt made the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
day to show that there was precedent for such a proceeding,
it seems to me, signally failed. Attention was then
called to a resolution adopted at a session of Congress
convened by the President of the United States for
a declared purpose, announced at the time in advance.
I think the course taken by Congress was regarded as
questionable, even under the peculiar circumstances.
But the two cases are different. The present session is
not like that. It is a continuing session of a Congress
begun on the 4th day of March last, being simply a
prolongation of that session; and the practical question
is, whether you will limit the business of Congress in
a general session called under a statute of the United
States. Clearly there is no precedent for any such proceeding.
You plunge into darkness without a guide.</p>

<p>But I go further, and I say, that, even if there were
a precedent, I would reject it; for I much prefer to
follow the National Constitution. I do not say that the
text of the Constitution positively forbids the proposition,
but I cannot doubt that the spirit of the Constitution
is against it. How often, in other times, have
we all throbbed with indignation at the resolution in
the other House, also in this Chamber, to stifle discussion
on a great question! You do not forget the odious
rule by the name of the “Gag,” attached to which was
the name of its author, beginning with the letter A.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
I hope there will be no other gag of a larger character
to be classified with the letter A. That was justly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
offensive, because it violated the right of petition; but
you propose not only to interfere with the right of petition,
but also with all possible measures concerning the
public welfare, except as they may relate to one single
business, and that in its narrowest relations.</p>

<p>I object to such a proposition as in its spirit unconstitutional.
I appeal to my associates to reject it, that
it may not pass into history as a precedent of evil example
to be employed against Freedom. You may see,
Sir, how obstructive it is, if you will glance at certain
matters within my own knowledge, which, I submit, it is
our duty to consider, and my duty as a Senator to press
upon your attention. No relations with political associates
can absolve me from official responsibility.</p>

<p>Every Senator, doubtless, has within his own knowledge
business which in his judgment deserves attention,
and other business which he does not doubt must
be acted on. There are Senators on the other side of
the Chamber who will plead the cause of the frontiers
menaced by the Indians. I have heard something of
that peril from chance travellers during these few weeks
past; and yet, by the proposition of my friend from
Rhode Island, we are to abandon the frontiers, and I
know no other reason than that the weather is too hot.
It may be hot in this Chamber; but it is hotter there.
The reports from the frontier show that danger has begun.
The sound of the war-whoop has broken even
into this Capitol. The corpses of fellow-countrymen lie
unburied on the roadside, and their memories haunt us.
And yet we fold our hands, and decline to supply the
needed protection.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner then alluded to the necessity of legislation to carry out
a recent treaty with Venezuela, and also the treaty with Russia.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>I mean that important treaty by which the Emperor
of Russia has ceded to the United States all his
possessions on the North American continent. The ratifications
were exchanged only about a fortnight ago.
Yesterday, the 4th of July, I was honored by a visit
from the Minister of Russia, who put into my hand a
cable despatch from St. Petersburg, announcing that
on the day before the Russian Commissioner left St.
Petersburg for Washington to make the formal surrender
of that vast region to the United States. To my
inquiry when the Commissioner would arrive the Minister
replied, “In a fortnight.” In a fortnight, then,
final proceedings will be had for the establishment of
your jurisdiction over that region, and two questions
arise: first, our duty to complete the contract, in consideration
of the cession, to pay $7,200,000; and, secondly,
our other duty to provide a proper government.
But the proposition of my friend from Rhode Island
would exclude these important topics from our consideration.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Anthony.</span> Would the Senator have the Senate originate
an appropriation bill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I would have the Senate originate a bill
for the government of this territory, and, if need be, originate
a bill for the payment of the money due. There is
no objection in the Constitution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Anthony.</span> It has never been done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I beg the Senator’s pardon; it has been
done again and again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Anthony.</span> An appropriation bill originated in the
Senate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Oh, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Anthony.</span> I never knew that to be done but once;
and then the House rejected it, refused to consider it.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator refers to what are called
the general appropriation bills. The Senate constantly
makes appropriations for individual cases and for carrying
out treaties. Does it not appropriate for private
claims, for salaries, for other obligations? In principle,
the present case does not differ from an appropriation
for an estate adjoining the Capitol. Alaska
is not an estate adjoining the Capitol; but it is to
be paid for.</p>

<p>That I may make this clearer, I call attention to
the very words of the treaty with Russia:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias shall appoint
with convenient despatch an agent or agents for the
purpose of formally delivering to a similar agent or agents
appointed on behalf of the United States the territory, dominion,
property, dependencies, and appurtenances which
are ceded as above, and for doing any other act which may
be necessary in regard thereto. But the cession, with the
right of immediate possession, is nevertheless to be deemed
complete and absolute on the exchange of ratifications, without
waiting for such formal delivery.”<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

</div>

<p>So that, by the terms of the treaty, on the exchange
of ratifications you became possessors of this jurisdiction;
and now, by the approaching surrender, through
an official agent, your jurisdiction will be consummated.
With this jurisdiction will be corresponding responsibilities.
You must govern the territory; you must provide
protection for the property and the other interests
there. Already, by the telegraph, we learn that a large
ship is about to leave San Francisco for Sitka, with
merchandise of all kinds. There is also the immense
fur-trade, which has been the exclusive Russian interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
ever since the discovery of the country, which will
be left open, without regulation, unless you interfere
by appropriate law. There is that most important fur,
the origin of wealth on that whole northwestern coast,
the sea-otter, which will be exposed to lawless and destructive
depredation, unless the Government supplies
some regulations. Will you not do something? Will
you leave these interests without care?</p>

<p>Senators exclaim, that they may be considered next
winter. Do not forget the distance between Washington
and that far-away region; you will then see how
long you postpone the establishment of your jurisdiction.
Months must elapse after the meeting of Congress
next December, leaving this region without government.
There should be no delay; you should proceed
at once. You certainly will not show yourselves
worthy to possess this country, unless you provide at
once a proper government. Leaving it a prey to lawless
adventure, you will only increase the difficulties
of dealing with a region so vast and so remote.</p>

<p>But there is another obligation still. You receive
the territory; you ought to pay the money at the same
time. A Senator before me cries out, “It will not be
appropriated at this session.”</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> It is not due yet.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I ask the Senator’s attention to the
point. I understand, as a matter of history, in this
negotiation, that, while it was proceeding, it was proposed
that the payment should be on the exchange of
ratifications, so that, when the cession was completed,
the transaction on our part should be completed also;
but as the treaty was being drawn, it was understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
that there would be no meeting of Congress before next
December, while the ratifications might be exchanged
before that time. To meet this case, a special provision
was introduced, extending the time of payment to a
period of ten months from the exchange of ratifications.
This explains the article I now read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In consideration of the cession aforesaid, the United
States agree to pay at the Treasury in Washington, within
ten months after the exchange of the ratifications of this
convention, to the diplomatic representative or other agent
of His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, duly authorized
to receive the same, seven million two hundred thousand
dollars in gold.”<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

</div>

<p>By the letter of the treaty, you may, if you see fit,
postpone the payment to ten months from the exchange
of ratifications; but I submit to the Senator from Vermont,
whether he is willing to do so,&mdash;whether, since
the transaction is consummated on the part of Russia,
he is not willing, nay, desirous also, that it shall be
consummated on the part of the United States in the
spirit of the original negotiation? I submit this as a
question of sound policy,&mdash;I will not say of integrity,
but simply of sound policy on the part of our Government,
a republic representing republican institutions,
by whose conduct republican institutions are always
judged. Surely you will not fail to protect the national
honor; nor will you stick at the letter of the
treaty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have alluded to two important matters under treaties;
but there is still another, more important than any
treaty or any appropriation, which dwarfs treaties and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
dwarfs appropriations, which is not less important, certainly,
than the protection of the frontier, now menaced
by Indians. I refer to a whole region of our Republic,
embracing two extensive States, now menaced by a foe
more dangerous to the national peace and welfare than
any tribe of Indians. These are returning Rebels in
the States of Kentucky and Maryland. Provide against
them. They are Indians within your jurisdiction. You
have the power; you have the means. Give the ballot
to the colored citizens in those States, as you have given
it already to colored citizens in the Rebel States, and
you will have an all-sufficient protection against these
intruders. Here is something to be done. Who doubts
the power? Out of three fountains in the Constitution
it may be derived. It is your duty, then, to exercise
it. See to it that these States have a republican government.
Fix in your statute-book an authoritative
definition of a republic. Enforce the two Amendments
of the Constitution,&mdash;one abolishing Slavery, and the
other declaring the rights of citizens. Any delay to
exercise so clear a power is a failure of duty; and it
becomes more reprehensible, when we consider the perils
that may ensue. Communicate, if you please, with
Union citizens of those two States. Listen to what
they say. Be taught by their testimony.</p>

<p>I have, for instance, a letter from an eminent citizen
of Maryland, written from Baltimore the 1st of July,
which concludes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I will only add, that the interest felt by the loyal people
of this State in the passage of this bill cannot be overstated.”</p>

</div>

<p>Communicate with your late colleague upon this
floor, that able and patriotic Senator, Mr. Creswell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Listen to his testimony. There can be no doubt that
Unionists, whether black or white, in Maryland, require
your protection. Give it to them. Do not leave
them a prey to Rebels. In the same way they are
exposed in Kentucky. Here is a letter from a distinguished
citizen of that State, dated July 1st: and
I read these, out of many others, simply because they
are the latest; they have come within a few hours:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I hope you will be able to do good at the extra session,
and extend and protect the rights of the freedmen, as they
are sadly in need of it in Kentucky. Reconstruct us; this
is the only loyal hope.”</p>

</div>

<p>Such is the cry. Kentucky needs reconstruction, and
it is your duty to provide it. Put her on an equality
with the Rebel States. Let her colored citizens enjoy the
full-blown rights of citizens, and let the white Unionists
there have the protection of their votes. You sent
muskets once; send votes now.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>On your table is a bill “to enforce the several provisions
of the Constitution abolishing Slavery, declaring
the immunities of citizens, and guarantying a republican
form of government by securing the elective franchise
to colored citizens.” Pass this bill, and you furnish
the needed protection in these semi-rebel States.
Pass this bill, and you supersede strife on this much-vexed
and disturbing question in other States of the
Union. You at once bring to the elective franchise
thousands of good citizens, pledged by their lives and
inspired by their recently received rights to sustain
the good cause which you have so much at heart. Do
this; help in this way the final settlement of the national
troubles; pass this bill of peace,&mdash;for such it
will be, giving repose in all the Northern States,&mdash;and
in this way help establish repose in all the rest
of the country. And yet I am told that even this important
measure is to be set aside. We are not to enter
upon its consideration; we are not to debate it; we
are not to receive petitions in its favor. Is this right?
Is it not a neglect of duty? Is it not intolerable?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, on these grounds I object to this proposition.
I might have objected to it, in the first place,
as out of order, and asked the ruling of the Chair, not
doubting how the Chair, inspired always by a generous
love of human rights, must rule,&mdash;not doubting that
the Chair would say that a proposition of such a character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
was too closely associated with one of the most
odious measures of our history to deserve welcome at
this time. I have raised no such question. I confine
myself now to other objections. I object to it as a
departure from sound usage, as contrary to the spirit
of the Constitution, and as setting up an impediment
and obstruction to the transaction of public business of
an urgent character, which you cannot neglect without
neglect of duty. I ask you to provide for the execution
of recent treaties with Venezuela and Russia, to
assure protection to Unionists in Maryland and Kentucky,
and to give peace to the country. Above all,
do not make a bad precedent, to be quoted hereafter
to the injury of the Republic.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Pomeroy, of Kansas, felt “embarrassed in voting against the
resolution offered by the Senator from Rhode Island,” but he thought
it “impracticable and unwise,” that it would “subject us to censure,
and that we ourselves should regret it hereafter.” Mr. Yates, of
Illinois, “was for a special session for a special purpose.” In reply to
a question of Mr. Yates, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I do not believe Congress would have come together,
if they had had faith in the President. I believe the
session beginning on the 4th of March had its origin
in want of confidence in the President. I believe my
friend agrees in that.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Yates.</span> Yes.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> It was to counteract and watch the
President that Congress met on the 4th of March.
When this session was about to adjourn, provision was
made for its renewal, or a continuation or a prolongation
of it, if you may so regard it. I take it in the
same spirit with the original enactment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>It was to provide against the President, and to do
such other incidental business as the public interests
might require. I never doubted that there would be
a session on the 3d of July.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> I so stated at the passage
of the resolution. I have so stated constantly
since; and I have advised more than one gentleman
connected with Congress not to leave the country, because
his post of duty was here. I believe that I have
answered the question of my friend.</p>

<p>And now one word more. We are assembled under
an Act of Congress and the National Constitution. By
the Constitution it is provided that “each House may
determine the rules of its proceedings.” That is all it
can do. It may not annihilate proceedings; it may
not forbid proceedings. It may provide rules for them;
but it cannot, in a just sense, prevent. Therefore I
submit that the resolution, if not positively unconstitutional,
is contrary to the spirit of that instrument.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Ross, of Kansas, hoped “that either the proposition of the Senator
from Massachusetts or something similar to it would carry.” Mr.
Tipton, of Nebraska, was “embarrassed in regard to voting for the
original resolution.” After further debate, the vote was taken on
Mr. Sumner’s substitute, and it was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 6, Nays 26.</p>

<p>Mr. Ross then moved a substitute limiting business “to removing
the obstructions which have been or are likely to be placed in the
way of the fair execution of the Acts of Reconstruction,” and “such
as may be rendered necessary for the preservation of the peace on the
Western frontier.” Debate ensued, in which Mr. Howe, of Wisconsin,
said: “I did not suppose any gentleman would insist that I was bound
by the decision of that body, or by the conclusion arrived at in that
consultation.… I do not know what penalties I subject myself to by
disagreeing here and now with the conclusions then arrived at.” Mr.
Wade, of Ohio, spoke vigorously against the original resolution. In his
judgment, “there are some questions about which a Senator has no
right to conform his view to that of the majority,” and he took the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
resolution to be of that class. “It sets a precedent of the greatest
danger in high party times.” He hoped “that no such detriment to
a minority will ever be successfully urged here.” He judged Mr. Sumner’s
“measure, which is to give universal suffrage by Act of Congress,
to be upon the subject of Reconstruction, and one of the most
efficient measures to that end; and yet gentlemen seem to suppose
that that is within the scope of the excluding clause of this resolution.”
Mr. Fessenden was equally positive the other way. He referred
to the caucus of Republican Senators where the original resolution
was prepared, which he deemed “eminently proper.” “When
gentlemen go into consultation with their friends, and make no protest
whatever against having the result of that consultation acted
upon, they agree impliedly and expressly, in my judgment, that they
will be bound on that subject by the decision which their friends come
to, unless they give notice to the contrary,&mdash;that is to say, in case
they continue to act on the subject to the end.” Mr. Sumner followed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I should not have said another
word, but for topics introduced by the Senator from
Maine; yet before I allude to those particularly, allow
me to answer his argument, so far as I am able to
appreciate it. He will pardon me for saying that he
confounds right and power. Unquestionably the Senate
has the power which he attributes to it; but it has
not the right. A jury, as we know, in giving a general
verdict, has power to say “Guilty” or “Not guilty,” disregarding
the instructions of the court; but I need not
say that it is a grave question among lawyers whether it
has the right. Now, assuming that the Senate has the
power which the Senator from Maine claims, it seems
to me it has not the right. It has not the right to disregard
the spirit of the National Constitution; and the
present proposition is of that character. The Senator
does not see it so, I know; for, if he did, he could not
give to it the weight of his character. Others do see it
so; and if they do, the Senator from Maine must pardon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
them, if they act accordingly. The Senator would
not vote for anything he regarded as hostile to the spirit
of the Constitution. I cannot attribute to him any such
conduct. Can he expect others to do what he would
not do himself? This is my answer to the argument,
so far as I understand it. Perhaps I do not do justice
to it; yet I try.</p>

<p>There was one other point of argument. The Senate,
so the Senator argues, may postpone an individual
measure to the next session. Grant it; does it follow
that they may postpone, immediately on their arrival,
the whole business to another session?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> They can adjourn on the next day, or
on the day they meet, if they please.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> But so long as they continue in session
as a Senate, then, under the National Constitution,
they must attend to the business of the country.
They cannot tie their hands in advance. To do so is
to violate the spirit of the Constitution. The Senator
cannot have forgotten the Atherton gag, to which I
referred before, without naming it, however. Was it
not justly an offence and a stench in the nostrils of
every patriot citizen? Has it not left a bad name upon
the Congresses that recognized it? But this was simply
a declaration not to receive petitions on one subject;
and now, under the lead of the Senator, we are
to continue in session an indefinite time, and to receive
no petition, no bill, nothing on anything except on one
specified subject. I submit, if the Atherton gag was
unconstitutional, if it was odious, if it was a bad precedent,
then you are very rash in establishing this much
broader precedent. Do not condemn the offensive legislation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
of the past; do not condemn those slave-masters
once so offensive in these Chambers. You go further
than they. You impose a gag not upon petitions merely,
but upon the general business of the country.</p>

<p>The Senator from Ohio [Mr. <span class="smcap">Wade</span>] has, with unanswerable
force, depicted the offensive character of
this precedent, and he has taught us how, now that
we are a majority, we should hesitate to set such an
example for the future. How should we feel, he has
aptly reminded us, if, as a minority, we had such a
cup handed to our lips by a patriot Senator? Doubtless,
that for the time patriotism had departed.</p>

<p>I should not have been betrayed into these remarks
now, but for topics introduced by the Senator from
Maine. When I opened this debate, this morning, Senators
will bear me witness, I made no allusion to any
discussion elsewhere. I did not think a caucus a proper
subject for this Chamber; nor did I attribute to it anything
of the character which the Senator from Maine
does. He makes it not merely sacred, but a <em>sacro-sanct
pact</em>, by which every one at the meeting is solemnly
bound. What authority is there for any such conclusion?
Senators went to that caucus, I presume, like
myself, without knowing what was to be considered;
and let me confess, when the proposition, in its first
form, was presented, I was startled by its offensive
character. I could not believe that a Senator, knowing
the responsibilities and duties of a Senator, and
under the oath of a Senator, could start such a thing.
Well, Sir, discussion went on. The proposition was
amended, modified, mitigated, losing something of its
offensiveness in form, but it still remained substantially
offensive. I am not aware that any Senator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
suggested that it should be adopted as a rule of the
Senate. If any one did, I did not hear it, though paying
close attention to the discussion. I do not think
the Senator from Maine made any such suggestion. I
certainly never supposed that anybody would propose
such a rule. So far as it was to have any value, I
supposed it was to be the recorded result of the deliberations
of political associates,&mdash;so far as practicable,
a guide for their action, but not a constraint embodied
in a perpetual record. At the last moment, after the
vote had been declared to which the Senator from
Maine refers, and to which I should make no allusion,
if he had not brought it forward, I rose in the caucus,
and said, “I will not be bound by any such proposition.”
When it had arrived at the stage to which I
refer,&mdash;the Senator from Maine will not forget it, for he
interposed a remark which I will not quote now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> You had better quote it. I said, “Then
you should not have voted on the subject, if you did not
mean to be bound by the decision of the majority.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> To which I replied, “I am a Senator
of the United States.”</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> I did not hear the reply.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> By that reply I meant that my obligations
as a Senator were above any vote in caucus;
that I had no right to go into caucus and barter away
unquestioned rights on this floor. We are under obligations
here to discharge our duties as Senators. We
cannot in advance tie our hands. I have not said in
so many words, “You violate the Constitution in doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
it.” Perhaps better reflection would lead me to adopt
the stronger language, and say, “You violate the National
Constitution.” I feel plainly, clearly, beyond
doubt, that such is the character of the National Constitution,
and such are our obligations under it, that
we cannot, without a dereliction of duty, consent to
such a proposition. So I see it; I cannot see it otherwise.</p>

<p>And now I submit to my associates in this body,
with whom I am proud to act, whose good opinion I
value, whether they would have me, feeling as I do
regarding this resolution, act otherwise than as I do.
Should I not, as an associate in this Chamber, anxious
for the good name of the Senate to which we all belong,
proud of this Republic whose honor we hope to
bear aloft, and anxious that no precedent should be
established which may hereafter be brought to our detriment,
should I not enter my frank protest? And,
doing so, do I deserve the rude suggestions that have
been made to-day? Should I be told that one may
not go into a caucus and assist in the debate, and then
appear in this Chamber only with the bands of the
caucus upon his hands?</p>

<p>Nor is the duty changed by the time of the protest.
Vote or no vote makes no difference. No caucus
could constrain a Senator on such a question. It
was our duty to stay and resist the offensive proposition
to the last, and then afterward resist it elsewhere.
Senators, if they choose, may take it in their hands and
bear it into this Chamber, to enshrine it in the rules
of the Senate. If placed there, I know it will do no
good; it will stay there to the dishonor of the country,
and as a bad precedent for the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Howe spoke again, beginning his remarks as follows: “I am
not so familiar with the history of this country as I wish I was. I
do not know whether it has ever happened hitherto in the history
of the country that a Senator has been arraigned before the Senate
for a violation of a duty to a partisan caucus. If there ever has been
such a trial before, I hope there never will be such a trial again.”
Mr. Yates concluded by saying: “Now, Sir, there is one of two
things, and it commences this day: that the decisions of such consultations
have to be carried out, or this day begins the death of any
consultations by the majority in the Senate.” Mr. Sumner followed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;It is evident that this debate has
opened a broader question than was imagined at first.
Doctors disagree. The learned Senator from Illinois
differs from the learned Senator from Maine. One expounds
the caucus obligations in one way, and the other
in another. Now I am clear that this debate ought not
to be closed without some defined code of caucus, and
it seems to me that the learned Senators, so swift in
judgment, ought to supply this code. It should be reduced
to a text. We should know to what extent one
is bound, and to what extent not bound: whether the
Senator from Illinois, who refuses to be bound by the
caucus in one point, which was fully discussed, is a
man of honor; whether another Senator, who refuses to
be bound on other points, is a man of honor. That
question could be settled by some explicit code: for we
have been admonished that we cannot differ from the
caucus without a departure from propriety, if not from
duty; and I do not know that stronger language has
not been employed. If it has, I will not quote it. It
seems to me that this should lead to a practical conclusion,
and it is this: to have nothing to do with a
proposition which can be discussed only through such
avenues, which requires such refinement of detail, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
regard to which the Senator from Illinois makes one
exception, and other Senators other exceptions, and to
which still other Senators entirely object.</p>

<p>Now I am not going to complain of the Senator from
Illinois. In following his convictions he is doing right;
but then I wish him to understand that others on this
floor may have the privilege he claims for himself,&mdash;justly
claims; it is his title. I recognize the Senator
as a man of honor, though he does refuse to carry out
the decrees of the caucus. I believe that every Senator
here has responsibilities as a Senator which are above
any he can have to a caucus, which is only a meeting
of friends for consultation and for harmony, where
each gives up something with a view to a common result,
but no man gives up a principle, no man gives up
anything vital. No Senator can expect another Senator
to give up anything vital; no Senator can expect
another Senator to sacrifice a principle. I will not imagine
that any Senator would sacrifice a principle. If
a Senator expects another to accord with him in the
conclusions of a caucus, I know well it is because he
does not see it in the light of principle; but if another
Senator does see it in the light of principle, how can
he be expected to act otherwise than according to his
light? It is not given to all to see with the clearness
of the caucus-defenders. Theirs is the pathway of light;
they see the obligation as complete. Others cannot see
it so. I am in that list. I cannot see it as a final obligation.
I have been present in many caucuses, and I
believe, looking over the past, I have harmonized reasonably
with my associates. Sometimes I have been
constrained to differ, and have expressed that difference,
and it has generally been received with kindness. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
other day I expressed the same difference, little expecting,
however, an arraignment on this floor.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Here followed a conversation, in which Mr. Sumner, Mr. Yates, Mr.
Howe, Mr. Grimes, of Iowa, and Mr. Thayer, of Nebraska, took part.
Mr. Yates was willing to except from the resolution necessary legislation
on the Western frontiers. Mr. Sumner continued:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Now I submit to my excellent friend, whether his
conclusion does not entirely impair the value of the
caucus conclusion, except to this extent, in which we
all agree, that it is an expression of the opinion of political
associates, calculated to exercise a strong influence
on the course of public business, and to be received
with respect, but not to be imposed upon this
Chamber as a rule.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Yates.</span> Allow me to ask the Senator whether he
did not submit himself to the same sort of decision in the
Reconstruction measures. Those matters were before a caucus,
and acted upon.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> In the caucus on Reconstruction I
moved the amendment that in the future constitutions
of the Rebel States the ballot should be required. A
division was had. I allude to it now because interrogated
openly in the Senate. A division was had, and
there were two stand-up votes, when the motion was
carried by a vote of 15 to 13. By 15 to 13 in that
caucus it was voted to require suffrage for all in the
future constitutions of the Rebel States.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> And what would you have thought, if
the thirteen had repudiated that action?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> To repudiate a proposition in favor
of human liberty would have been a very different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
thing from repudiating a proposition against human
liberty.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> When the question is put to the Senator,
what he would have thought, if the thirteen had repudiated
it, he says that is a very different thing, being in favor
of liberty.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Very well, does not the Senator say
the same?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> I say there is no difference, where a man
promises to do a thing with a full understanding; he has no
right to violate it, whether it is one way or the other.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The question is, whether the man does
promise. There is the point.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> Very well, then, my reply is, that, if
there was no promise in the case of the thirteen to support
the decision, there is no promise here; if there was a promise
in the case of the thirteen to be bound by it and support it,
as they did, then there was a promise here. The Senator
may make the distinction, if he can.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I will make the distinction clear. I
have never said there was a promise in the case of the
thirteen, as I insist there was no promise in the recent
caucus. Had the Senator felt it his duty to come into
the Senate and oppose the report, I should have been
pained to find him on the side of wrong; but I am not
ready to say that he would have been constrained by
the caucus. But, plainly, the repudiation of a caucus
vote for Human Rights is to be judged differently from
the repudiation of a caucus vote adverse to Human
Rights,&mdash;assuming, as I do, that there is no promise
in either case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>Sir, I am tired of this talk of honor, in connection
with the public business. This is too solemn; we are
under too great responsibilities. Every Senator acts
with honor. The Senator from Maine acts with honor,
when he seeks to impose a rule which I think offensive
to the spirit of the Constitution. The Senator
from Illinois acts with honor, when he says that he
will not be bound by the vote of this caucus in a
particular case. Other Senators act with honor, when
they refuse to be bound by the resolution in any of
its terms. Every Senator acts with honor. He only
acts otherwise who makes injurious imputations upon
his associates.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, let us have this caucus code. If it is to
be administered with such severity, let us know it in
advance, its terms and its conditions,&mdash;what extent of
dishonor is to be visited upon those who do not adopt
the caucus conclusions, and what extent of honor upon
those who so steadfastly and violently carry them forward.
Let us have the code. I believe, Sir, that the
true code for the Senate is found in the National Constitution,
in the rules of this body, and in the sentiments
of right and wrong which animate every honest
soul; and I believe that no advantage can be taken of
any Senator by reminding him that he forbore at a
particular moment to register his objection, just as if
we were all there on trial, to be saved by speaking
promptly. It was no such debate; we were there with
friends and brothers, each respecting the sensibilities
and convictions of his associates, and, by interchange
of opinions, seeking harmony, but not submitting to a
yoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>After further remarks from Mr. Fessenden and Mr. Tipton, the substitute
of Mr. Ross was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 15, Nays 19. The resolution,
was then adopted,&mdash;Yeas 23, Nays 9.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>July 10th, Mr. Sumner called up the following, introduced by him
July 8th:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the resolution of the Senate, adopted the 5th of July
last, limiting the business of the Senate, be, and hereby is, rescinded.”</p>

</div>

<p>In remarks that followed, he showed the character of the proceedings
in the Twenty-Seventh Congress, which had been adduced as a
precedent for the limitation of business. In reply to Mr. Fessenden,
he said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I have simply done my duty, in calling attention
to the past precedent which had been introduced into
the discussion. When it was introduced by the Senator
from Maine, I had no means of replying to it.
I had not the Journal or the Globe with me, and I
supposed, from the statement of the Senator, that it
was a resolution practically adopted in this Chamber.
I was not aware of what followed. I was not aware
of the extent to which the whole spirit of the proposition
was denounced. Nor was I aware that its original
mover, Mr. Clay, was obliged to abandon his proposition,&mdash;that
he magnanimously, justly, and considerately
abandoned it. That is the true precedent in this
body; and that is the precedent which, I submit, it
would be better for the Senate to follow. Nothing,
surely, could be lost by following it.</p>

<p>The resolution adopted by the Senate on Friday, while
it remains, will only be of evil example. If hereafter
quoted as a precedent, it may be at last for some purpose
of oppression, when Senators will not all be as just
as those I now have the honor of addressing. It may
be seized then as an engine of tyranny. For one, Sir,
I would leave no such weapon in this Chamber to be
grasped hereafter by any hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The Senate refused to take up the resolution.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>July 13th, Mr. Sumner made another attempt by the following resolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the rule of the Senate limiting business be suspended,
so far as to allow the consideration of the bill (S. No. 124) to enforce the

immunities of citizens, and guarantying a republican form of government
by securing the elective franchise to colored citizens.”</p>

was left on the table.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>July 8th, Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
reported a “Bill to give effect to an Act entitled ‘An Act to
provide for the more efficient Government of the Rebel States,’ passed
March 2, 1867.” This was the third Reconstruction measure of the
present year. It was debated for several days. July 11th, Mr. Sumner
said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;Before offering amendments
which I have on my table, I desire to call attention
briefly to the character of this bill.</p>

<p>The subject of Reconstruction has been before Congress
for many years. It first appeared in the Senate
as a proposition of my own, as long ago as February,
1862. From that time it has been constantly present.
If at any moment Congress has erred, it has been from
inaction, and not from action. And now the same danger
is imminent.</p>

<p>Mark, if you please, the stages. At every step there
has been battle. Nothing could be proposed which was
not opposed, often with feeling, sometimes even with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
animosity. I do not speak now of the other side, but
of friends on this side of the Chamber, some of whom
have fought every measure.</p>

<p>To my mind nothing has been plainer from the beginning
than the jurisdiction of Congress. Obviously
it was not for the Executive, but for the Legislative.
The President was commander-in-chief of the army;
that function was his. But he could not make States
or constitutions, or determine how States or constitutions
should be made. All that he did to this end
was gross usurpation, aggravated by motives and consequences.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the jurisdiction was in Congress;
and I shall never cease to lament that it was not
asserted promptly and courageously. Our delay has
postponed the establishment of peace and reconciliation.
Much as the President has erred, Congress has
not been without error also. The President erred from
assuming powers which did not belong to him; Congress
erred from declining to assume powers which belonged
to it. The sins of the President were of commission;
the sins of Congress were of omission. The
President did the things he ought not to have done;
Congress left undone the things it ought to have done.</p>

<p>In the exercise of unquestioned jurisdiction, Congress
should at once have provided civil governments,
through whose influence and agency the Rebel States
might have been shaped into republican forms. Such
a proceeding would have been more constitutional and
more according to the genius of our institutions than
that which was adopted. It is hard to reconcile a military
government, or any government born of military
power, with the true idea of a republic. Tardily, too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
tardily, Congress entered upon the work; and then began
hesitations of another character. Even when assuming
jurisdiction, it halted.</p>

<p>For a long time it refused to confer the suffrage upon
the colored race. At last this was done.</p>

<p>Then it refused to exclude Rebels from the work of
Reconstruction; and when at last it attempted something,
its rule of exclusion was so little certain that
an ingenious lawyer by a written opinion has set it
aside.</p>

<p>There have been bills with riders, and after the passage
of these bills there has been a supplementary bill
with riders. And still further legislation is needed.</p>

<p>Surely these successive failures have their lesson.
They admonish us now to make thorough work.</p>

<p>If you will not establish civil governments, with the
military power simply as a support, then at least do not
hesitate to vacate the existing governments, which are
so many roots and centres of sedition. All the officers
of these governments, from highest to lowest, exercise
an influence adverse to a just reconstruction. They are
in the way of peace and reconciliation. They increase
the essential difficulties of forming new governments.
Through their influence a hostile spirit is engendered
and sustained. Such an obstacle should be removed.</p>

<p>At the same time be careful that Rebel influence is
not allowed to prevail in the new governments. Of
course this can be only by excluding Rebels during this
transition period, until the new governments are formed.
The rule of exclusion may be properly changed, when
loyal and republican governments are established. Attention
has already been called to cases deserving notice:
as, for instance, naturalized citizens who have taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
an oath to support the National Constitution and afterward
became Rebels, but yet are not excluded; cadets
at the Military and Naval Academies; persons who have
contributed to Rebel loans or invested money in Rebel
bonds or securities; contractors who furnished Rebel
supplies; also persons who, as authors, publishers, editors,
contributors, or as speakers or preachers, encouraged
the secession of any State or the waging of war
against the United States.</p>

<p>Considering what we hear with regard to the boards
of registration,&mdash;that in some States they are of doubtful
principles, that in others colored fellow-citizens are
excluded, so that a large proportion of the electors have
no representation in the boards,&mdash;it seems to me that
we ought by positive words to provide that the boards
shall be constituted without distinction of color. Colored
persons may be chosen to office, and I cannot
doubt that we shall soon welcome colored Senators and
Representatives to the National Capitol. Meanwhile
the boards of registration must be kept as open as these
Chambers; and no commanding general can be allowed
to set up a rule adverse to the rights of a race.</p>

<p>A system of public schools without distinction of
color should be required. This important duty must
not be left to caprice, or to the triumph of truth through
local influence. Its performance should be enforced as
essential to republican government. We have required
suffrage for all; we should require also education for
all.</p>

<p>Provision should be made to invalidate the decrees
of court in the Rebel States which have not been voluntarily
executed. This is necessary for the protection
of loyal persons. Look, for instance, at Texas, where,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
according to recent report, immense sums have been
taken by unjust decrees. If the remedy is not applied
now, it is doubtful if the opportunity will not be lost
forever.</p>

<p>In submitting a constitution to the people, it seems
to me advisable that it should not be complicated by
any election of officers, State or National, but that all
elections should be postponed until after approval of the
constitution by Congress.</p>

<p>There should also be penalties for the violation of the
Act. The pardon of the President must not be allowed
to confer a title to vote; and since officials have shown
such a disposition to impair the efficacy of an Act by
interpretation, reducing it to a mere shadow, we ought
to provide that it shall be interpreted liberally.</p>

<p>In making these propositions, I ask that you should
not hesitate simply because they may not be embraced
within the terms of the original Acts. I would do now
all that we can to make this measure of Reconstruction
just and beneficent. I know no other rule worthy of
the Senate or adequate to the occasion.</p>

<p>In carrying out these ideas, I propose to offer several
amendments, which I will send to the Chair in order.
I begin by an amendment as an additional section:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>And be it further enacted</i>, That every constitution in the
Rebel States shall require the Legislature to establish and
sustain a system of public schools open to all, without distinction
of race or color.”</p>

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Trumbull objected to the amendment as not in order under the
rule limiting the business of the session. The question of order was
submitted to the Senate, and the amendment was ruled out of order,&mdash;Yeas
11, Nays 22.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
<p>Mr. Sumner then moved the following amendment, which he was
sure must be in order, even under the stringent rule of the Senate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That no person shall be disqualified as member of any board
of registration by reason of race or color.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Conkling, of New York, inquired “whether there is any doubt
upon the law, as it stands now, that men otherwise qualified are eligible,
notwithstanding they are black.” Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I am accustomed to that class of questions on this
floor. When, some two or three years ago, I felt it
my duty to move, on one bill after another, that there
should be no exclusion from the street cars on account
of color, I was encountered by learned lawyers, and
by none more constantly than my friend opposite, the
Senator from Maryland [Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>], with precisely
the suggestion which my friend from New York now
makes: that in point of law it was unnecessary; that
under the actual law, which was none other than the
Common Law, there could be no exclusion on account
of color: and yet, in the face of that Common Law, Senators
all know that there was an exclusion from the
cars on account of color, and the grossest outrages committed.
Colored persons were precipitated into the
streets, into the mud, under a pelting rain, and they
could obtain no redress; and when I asked for redress,
grave Senators said, “Let them apply to the courts”;
and it was suggested that perhaps I had better volunteer
as counsel in court rather than appear in this
Chamber. Now the question of my friend from New
York is precisely in the same spirit. I cannot doubt,
that, under the existing Reconstruction law, there can
be no exclusion on account of color,&mdash;that nobody is
for that reason disqualified from the exercise of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
function. What is there to prevent a colored person
from being a Senator of the United States? and who
can doubt that within a very few months it will be our
business to welcome a colored Senator on this floor?
I cannot doubt it.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Johnson</span> [of Maryland]. How many?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> That I do not know. But I ask you
who look to the colored vote in these States as the
means of security and peace, through which you are to
find protection for this Republic, and for white fellow-citizens
there as well as for the colored themselves, to
see that this stigma is not put upon them by any commanding
general pretending to act by virtue of our
legislation. It is not enough to tell me, that, under
the actual law, colored persons may be designated. To
that I reply, in the State of Virginia they have not
been designated; and I wish now that Congress should
declare that any exclusion on account of color is without
the sanction of law.</p>

<p>And that brings me to the inquiry of my friend from
Illinois, as to the penalty, I think, or as to the extent
of the remedy.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Trumbull.</span> The question was, whether your proviso
afforded any remedy.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> That I will answer. My proviso affords
precisely the same remedy that it afforded on the
Railroad Bills. It is in nearly the same terms. I followed
those terms, because I know my friend likes good
precedents, and we have enough of those on the question
of the street cars. The Senate adopted that proviso
at least half a dozen times. There it is, without penalty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
and yet it has been most efficacious, not only in these
streets, but as an example throughout the country.
Adopt this proviso now, and I am sure it will be most
efficacious with our generals even without any penalty.
Should they exclude fellow-citizens on account of color,
it will be a violation of law and a failure of duty;
there can be no votes of thanks for them,&mdash;“no hope
of golden spurs to-day.”</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Conkling replied: “I do not wish, for one, to vote for an
amendment which I think carries nothing with it, but which simply
incumbers the bill with unnecessary, and I might say verbose provisos.”</p>

<p>The amendment was rejected by a tie-vote,&mdash;Yeas 18, Nays 18.</p>

<p>At the next stage of the bill, Mr. Sumner renewed his amendment.
In reply to Mr. Edmunds, of Vermont, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I will not spend time. There has been an abuse
which has come to our knowledge. We know that
in whole States colored persons are excluded from the
boards, and this justifies our intervention.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>On this second trial the amendment was adopted,&mdash;Yeas 21, Nays 8.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner offered the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>And be it further enacted</i>, That there shall be no elections of State
or National officers under any new constitution until after the same has
been approved by Congress.”</p>

</div>

<p>This was objected to by Mr. Trumbull, as out of order under the
rule, and so decided by the Senate.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner then moved the following amendment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>And be it further enacted</i>, That in each of these States all judgments
and decrees of court which have not been voluntarily executed, and which
have been rendered subsequently to the date of the Ordinance of Secession
in each State respectively, shall be subject to appeal to the highest court in
the State, organized after the State shall be admitted again by Congress
into the Union; but no such appeal shall be allowed, unless the motion
for the same shall have been lodged in the court, or clerk’s office of
the court, in which the decree was rendered, within sixty days after the
governor appointed under this Act shall have entered upon the discharge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>of the duties of his office, and for all judgments rendered subsequently to
such date, within sixty days after the same have been rendered.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Trumbull objected to it as out of order under the rule. Mr.
Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>My attention has often been called to the necessity
of such a provision, by gentlemen from the South, and
especially by lawyers there. They tell me that without
some such provision the grossest injustice will be done.
Throughout the whole Rebellion the local tribunals
were sitting to administer justice; yet it was not justice,
but injustice, that they administered. Under their
decrees private rights were overthrown; and I doubt
not that my friend from Illinois has recently read the
account of an extensive injustice in Texas, where private
property to an almost incalculable amount was
taken away by these unjust decrees.</p>

<p>Should there not be a remedy? I think all will
say that there should be. This is, if I may so express
myself, the last time of asking. If those States
are once organized as States and received into the
Union, I know not if we have the power of applying
a remedy. That we have now I am sure. I cannot
doubt our constitutional power at this moment to set
aside all those decrees, so far as they have not been
voluntarily submitted to, or subject them, according to
the provision of my amendment, to appeal in a higher
tribunal after the reorganization of justice in these
States. Is not the provision reasonable? Is it not
to serve the ends of justice? If you do not accept
it now, can you accept it at any time hereafter? And
if you do not accept it now or hereafter, will not these
parties go without remedy? On that question I do
not pronounce dogmatically. I do not mean to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
that they will be absolutely without remedy; but I
do not easily see their remedy. I see difficulties in
the way, while at this moment I see no difficulties
in the way.</p>

<p>Then I encounter the objection that this is not in
order. Why not? Is it not to carry out your Reconstruction
Bill, to smooth difficulties, to remove wrong,
to establish justice? It may not have been specially
foreshadowed in the original bill or the supplemental
bill; but I submit that it is entirely germane to both
those bills. Besides, it is commended by an intrinsic
justice, which should make it acceptable at any time.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment was decided to be out of order.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner then offered this amendment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>And be it further enacted</i>, That all the provisions of this Act, and
of the Acts to which this is supplementary, shall be construed liberally,
to the end that all the intents thereof may be fully and perfectly carried
out.”</p>

</div>

<p>There was no objection of order to this amendment, and it was
agreed to without a division.</p>

<p>After further amendment the bill was ingrafted upon a House bill
on the same subject and passed,&mdash;Yeas 32, Nays 6. Being referred to
a Conference Committee, the report of the Committee was adopted: in
the Senate, Yeas 31, Nays 6,&mdash;and in the House, Yeas 111, Nays 23.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>July 13th, on the report of the Conference Committee in the Senate,
Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>And now, as we are about to dismiss this subject
for the present session, I cannot forbear again expressing
regret that the measure has not been made more
complete,&mdash;in one word, more radical. This is the
third bill of Reconstruction on which we have acted.
We ought never to have acted on more than one; and
had the Senate been sufficiently radical, had it founded
its bill on clear, definite principle, there would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
been no occasion for more than one. Just so far as
we have failed to found ourselves on clear, definite principle,
our bills have failed; and should there be failure
under the present bill, it will be precisely on that account.</p>

<p>I shall never cease to lament that Congress did not
at once assume jurisdiction of the whole region, and in
the exercise of its plenary authority establish civil governments,
supplying ample military support. Such a
Reconstruction would have been founded on principles
to defy the criticism of history. I trust that what we
have done will be judged leniently hereafter. I know,
however, that it is not above criticism. Of course, such
Reconstruction would have removed out of sight all existing
State governments and municipal governments
set up by Rebel authority, or by the President in the
exercise of usurped power. In my opinion, it is not
too late to do this last work. Even if you decline to
establish civil governments, I think, that, under the
Military Bill, you should go forward and brush away
all the existing governments there. From information,
private and public, out of every one of the Rebel
States, I am led to this conclusion. Those governments,
whether State or municipal, are just so many engines
of Rebel influence. They stand in the way of Reconstruction.
They prevent the beneficent operation of
your work. But the Senate has declined that path.
I regret it, and now at this last moment record my
regret.</p>

<p>I am sorry to add that the Senate has declined to
require of these people conditions which I think essential
to republican government. One of these is a
system of public education. I can never cease to mourn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the failure in this regard. Here is a paper from New
Orleans, which has come to me since I have been at
my desk to-day, edited by colored persons,&mdash;and an
excellent paper it is,&mdash;“The New Orleans Tribune”
of July 9, 1867, which contains an article entitled
“Public Schools,” from which I will read a brief sentence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Who will open the public schools to all children? We
are of opinion that it will only be done by a colored mayor
with colored members of the city council. This opinion is
justified by facts.”</p>

</div>

<p>The article then sets forth the impediments in the way
of public schools. And yet, in the face of such intelligence
from the Rebel States, we decline to require
a system of public education as an essential element
in these new governments. I lament it; and I desire
again to record this sentiment.</p>

<p>I fear also, Mr. President, that in the operation of
this bill you will find that we have not been sufficiently
explicit in the exclusion of Rebel influence. I
have made my best effort to remove doubts and to enlarge
the exclusion. But, in saying this, I desire to add,
that, in my judgment, all exclusions belong to what I
call the transition period. When Reconstruction is accomplished,
the time will come for us to open the gates,&mdash;but
not till then.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>July 19th, the bill was vetoed by the President, and on the same
day it was re-passed by a two-thirds vote of both Houses: in the
Senate, Yeas 30, Nays 6,&mdash;and in the House, Yeas 109, Nays 25; so
that it became a law.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on a Bill to enforce several Provisions
of the Constitution by securing the Elective Franchise
to Colored Citizens, July 12, 1867.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>March 26, 1867, Mr. Sumner asked, and by unanimous consent
obtained, leave to introduce a bill to enforce the several provisions
of the Constitution abolishing Slavery, declaring the immunities of
citizens, and guarantying a republican form of government, by securing
the elective franchise to colored citizens, which was read twice by its
title and printed. He then remarked on the importance of the bill,
and said that it was intended to cut the Gordian knot of the Suffrage
question throughout the country.</p>

<p>At the session beginning July 3d, he made constant efforts for its
consideration, challenging objection and argument.</p>

<p>July 12th, he moved its consideration, calling it “the Capstone of
Reconstruction”; but the Third Reconstruction Bill was pressed by
Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, to the exclusion of the other. Mr. Sumner
would not antagonize his bill with that. As soon as the other
measure was disposed of, he pressed his bill again. It was objected
to by Mr. Edmunds, of Vermont, as not in order under the rule of
the session limiting business,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> and the question of order was referred
to the Senate. On this Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">My argument is precisely this, and I ask the attention
of my friend from Maryland [Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>].
We all know his eminence at the bar of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Supreme Court, and I submit to him this: We have
already by Reconstruction Acts conferred the suffrage
upon colored persons in the Rebel States; now is it
not important that our legislation should be completed
and rounded by conferring the suffrage in the other
States as conferred in the Rebel States? You have
conferred it in the Rebel States.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Johnson.</span> What has that to do with the other
States?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Will you have the great right of suffrage
depend upon Act of Congress in one half of the
Union, and not upon Act of Congress in the other half?
If you can pass an Act for one half, can you not for
the other half? I know the answer, that in the Rebel
States the fact of rebellion gives a power we have not
in the other States. But the present bill is founded not
simply on the fact of rebellion, but on the clause in
the National Constitution by which we are bound to
guaranty a republican form of government throughout
the whole country; also on the other clause by which
Slavery is abolished throughout the whole country, and
we are empowered by proper legislation to enforce it;
also that further clause by which the rights of citizens
are secured throughout the whole country, and we are
empowered by proper legislation to enforce it. Here
are three sources of power, equally applicable to all the
States, Rebel or Loyal. And now I submit that such
an Act for the Loyal States is only the just complement
to our action in the Rebel States.</p>

<p>How can you look the Rebel States in the face, when
you have required colored suffrage of them and fail to
require it in the other States? Be just; require it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
the Loyal States as you have required it in the Rebel
States. There is an unanswerable argument, and I submit
it on the question of order. If we are privileged
to consider only matters in aid of the original Reconstruction
measures, then do I say that this bill is in
aid of those measures, for it gives to them completeness
and roundness. Without this bill your original
measures are imperfect, ay, radically unjust. I know
it is said there is one title to legislation over the Rebel
States which we have not with regard to the Loyal
States,&mdash;to wit, that they have been in rebellion. But
the great sources of power in the two cases are identical;
they are one and the same.</p>

<p>There is the guaranty clause in the National Constitution,
the sleeping giant of the Constitution, never
until this recent war awakened, but now it comes forward
with a giant’s power. There is no clause like
it. There is no text which gives to Congress such supreme
power over the States. Then, as I have so often
said, are the two other clauses. Your power under the
Constitution is not less complete than beneficent.</p>

<p>I am not to be betrayed into the constitutional argument.
I am now on the question of order. I say that
this bill is essential to perfect the original Reconstruction
measures. You should not return to your homes
without this additional Act by which Reconstruction
is finished. If any Senator has any reason to bring
against this bill, if any one can suggest a doubt of its
constitutionality, I should like to hear the reason or
the doubt, and I shall be ready to answer it. I invite
discussion. I challenge the expression of any reason
against it, or of any doubt with regard to its constitutionality;
and I ask Senators to look at it as a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
measure of expediency as well as of justice. How will
you settle this question in the Loyal States? Here are
Delaware, Maryland,&mdash;my friend over the way will
not be sensitive when I allude to his State,&mdash;and Kentucky,
in each of which this measure will be the salvation
of Union citizens. In other States, like Pennsylvania,
it will rally at once&mdash;I am speaking now on
the question of expediency&mdash;twenty thousand votes to
the Union cause. In Indiana, too, it will settle the
Suffrage question. I say nothing of Iowa. There is
Wisconsin.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Trumbull.</span> They all vote there now.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Under the decision of the Supreme
Court. So much the better. There is Connecticut. It
would obtain three thousand votes there for the good
cause. A short Act of Congress will determine the political
fortunes of Connecticut for an indefinite period
by securing three thousand additional votes to the right
side. There is New York, also, where the bill would
have the same excellent beneficent influence.</p>

<p>Who, then, can hesitate? Look at it in any light
you please. Regard it as the completion of these Reconstruction
measures, as a constitutional enactment, or
as a measure of expediency to secure results we all
desire at the approaching elections, and who can hesitate?
There has been no bill before you for a long
time of more practical value than this. I hope there
will be no question about proceeding with it, and that
we may pass it before we separate to-night.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> I agree with my friend from Massachusetts,
that the bill has very great merit. It has supreme
moral merit. I agree to every word of it. I am a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
afraid, it is true, that there is a higher law that will bind us
not to pass it, for want of power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Want of power! Will the Senator be
good enough to state the reason?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> No, not on this point, because it is not
relevant to this question of order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> But, as the Senator is going into the question
of the want of power, I really wish he would deign to
enlighten us upon that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> My friend will have to go without it, so
far as I am concerned, for I shall not make it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Then I shall begin to think the Senator
cannot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> That is not a very dangerous state of
things; but there are others who can.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Senate decided the motion out of order,&mdash;Yeas 12, Nays 22.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>July 13th, and again on the 15th, Mr. Sumner made another effort,
by a resolution suspending the rule limiting business, so as to allow
the consideration of this bill; but he could not get a vote on the resolution.
The Senate rose without touching it.</p>

Equal Rights in the District of Columbia, July 16, 1867.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>July 16th, Mr. Sumner offered a petition from citizens of Washington,
setting forth, that, under the existing charter of Washington,
colored persons are excluded from office, and praying relief. He supported
the petition with the following bill “for the further security
of Equal Rights in the District of Columbia”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Be it enacted, &amp;c.</i>, That in the District of Columbia no person shall
be excluded from any office by reason of race or color, and all parts of
laws making any such discrimination are hereby repealed.”</p>

</div>

<p>The bill was read, when Mr. Sumner asked unanimous consent to
proceed with its consideration.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I think there can be no objection to this bill. It
is simply to carry out what is understood to be the
effect of existing legislation, but which practically does
not seem to be its effect. At the late election in the
District it appeared that by the terms of the charter
colored persons could not be qualified as aldermen, as
common-councilmen, or as assessors; and on examining
the charter, which I have now on my desk, I find that
by its terms, strictly construed, these offices are confined
to free white persons. By our legislation, all
persons, without distinction of color, can be voters, but
nothing is said about being office-holders. I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
doubt, that, under the Constitution, and particularly
since the recent legislation, the discrimination adverse
to colored persons is void; but practically it is not
so regarded. I submit, therefore, that it is proper in
Congress to remove this grievance.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Buckalew, of Pennsylvania, objected to its consideration, when
Mr. Sumner gave notice that he should endeavor to call it up the
next day. He gave further notice, that, if any objection were made,
he should move to suspend the rule limiting business so far as to
allow this bill to be considered.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>July 17th, on motion of Mr. Sumner, the Senate proceeded to consider
the bill. Mr. Hendricks, of Indiana, then said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Senator from Massachusetts was the author of the proposition
that the colored people should vote. He made the commencement of
that policy with the District of Columbia. He now claims&mdash;and I believe
his party friends have come up to his position&mdash;that that is to be
made universal throughout the States. I suppose he will be frank enough
to inform us whether it is intended as the commencement of the policy
that negroes shall be allowed to become office-holders, to hold both Federal
and State offices throughout the country,&mdash;whether he regards this
as the inauguration of that policy. I suppose he does, from the fact that
he expressed with a great deal of warmth, the other day, the desire that
he might see colored Senators here in a very short time. If we are to regard
it as the inauguration of the policy, it is well enough to know it.”</p>

</div>

<p>Without any reply, Mr. Sumner asked for a vote, when the bill
was passed,&mdash;Yeas 25, Nays 5.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>July 18th, in the other House, the bill was reported by Mr. Wilson,
of Iowa, from the Judiciary Committee, with the following substitute,
intended to avoid in legislation the repetition of the phrase
“race or color.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The word ‘white,’ wherever it occurs in the laws relating to the District
of Columbia or in the charter or ordinances of the city of Washington
or Georgetown, and operates as a limitation on the right of any elector
of said District or either of said cities to hold any office or to be selected
and to serve as a juror, be and the same is hereby repealed; and it shall
be unlawful for any person or officer to enforce or attempt to enforce said
limitation after the passage of this Act.”</p>

</div>

<p>The substitute was adopted, and the bill thus amended passed,&mdash;Yeas
90, Nays 20.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>
<p>July 19th, the Senate concurred in the amendment, and, on motion
of Mr. Harlan, of Iowa, further amended the bill by an additional section
authorizing “the necessary grand and petit jurors for the June
term of the Criminal Court for the year 1867.” This amendment, though
not relating to Equal Rights, was concurred in by the House.</p>

<p>July 20th, the bill was duly enrolled and transmitted to the President
for his signature, but was not returned by him before the adjournment,
the same day, so that it failed to become a law. Mr. Sumner
complained that Senators “proposed to go home and leave Equal
Rights in the District without the protection we owe them.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>November 21st, on the first day of the meeting of Congress after
the adjournment, Mr. Sumner introduced the same bill as it had
passed both Houses, and asked the Senate to proceed with it at once;
but this was prevented by the objection of Mr. Davis, of Kentucky.
Mr. Sumner forbore calling it up for eleven consecutive days of the
session, to see if within that time it would be returned to Congress,
with or without objections. It was not returned, and on application
at the Department of State it was ascertained that it had not
been received there.</p>

<p>December 5th, the bill was taken up, on motion of Mr. Sumner, discussed,
and again passed,&mdash;Yeas 32, Nays 8.</p>

<p>December 9th, it passed the House,&mdash;Yeas 104, Nays 39.</p>

<p>December 11th it was presented to the President.</p>

<p>December 20th, Congress adjourned for the holidays.</p>

<p>The President, by a message, January 24, 1868, in reply to an inquiry
of the Senate, stated that it was presented for his approval December
11, 1867, but that “Congress by their adjournment [December
20th] prevented the return of the bill within the time prescribed by the
Constitution.”</p>

<p>January 7th, Mr. Sumner a third time introduced the same bill.
Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, thought “we ought to consider whether it is
not already a law.” Mr. Edmunds, of Vermont, said that “this bill
has become a law, if it has not been returned with a veto.” Under
these circumstances, the bill was referred to the Judiciary Committee
to consider its true condition and the question of further legislation.</p>

<p>February 11, 1869, the bill being once more before the Senate, Mr.
Sumner moved it again, as appears by the following passage.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I move that the Senate proceed to the consideration of
Senate bill No. 228.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Drake</span> [of Missouri]. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> A bill for the further security of Equal Rights in the
District of Columbia. I will make one minute’s explanation, and then
the Senate will see that it ought to be passed. This bill has already twice
passed both Houses of Congress, but immediately before recesses, and it
has fallen from the President failing to return it with his veto, and from
the unsettled condition of the practice or law in such cases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Presiding Officer</span> [Mr. <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>, of New York, in the chair].
It requires the unanimous consent of the Senate to consider the bill at
this time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Drake.</span> I appeal to the honorable Senator from Massachusetts
on behalf of a poor and most worthy woman&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Why should the Senator make that appeal to me? I
appeal on behalf of all the colored people in this District, who ask the
passage of this bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conkling</span> [of New York]. Whether the objection should be made
or not depends perhaps upon this, which I should like to inquire: Has
not this bill not only passed twice, I think three times, but has it not
become a law certainly once?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> It has not become a law; at least, it has not found place
in the statute-book, and the courts have declined to recognize it as law.
Under the circumstances, it has seemed the best and the shortest way for
Congress to pass it again, so as to remove all doubt.</p>

</div>

<p>The bill passed the Senate without a division, and, March 2d, it
again passed the other House without a division. Again it failed
to receive the signature of the President, nor was it returned with
his objections.</p>

<p>March 6th, at the opening of a new Congress, with a new President,
Mr. Sumner introduced it again, and asked unanimous consent to proceed
with its consideration; but Mr. Vickers, of Maryland, objected.</p>

<p>March 8th, it passed the Senate without a division; March 15th,
passed the other House,&mdash;Yeas 111, Nays 46; March 18th, was approved
by the President, and so at last became a law.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

the word “white” out of the statute-book, wherever it
appears. If the Senator from Vermont is disposed to
keep it in, then I can understand that he would object

<p>July 19th, the Senate considered a resolution from the other House
to reassemble November 13th. Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, moved to amend
by making the day of meeting “the first Monday of December next.”
Mr. Sumner moved to amend the amendment by substituting “the
second Wednesday of October next.” He then said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">On that question I have a word to say, and I must
speak frankly. I cannot help it. How Congress,
after listening to the message of to-day,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> which is only
the logical consequence of other messages, can quietly
vote to go home and leave this post of duty until next
winter, passes my understanding. To me it is incomprehensible.
The message, from beginning to end, is a
menace. Needless to quote its precise language. Its
defiant tone fills this Chamber, and will soon fill the
whole country. Listening to this appeal, so well calculated
to revive the dying Rebellion, I felt that one
of two things was needed,&mdash;the removal of its author
from the Executive chair, or Congress in permanent
session to watch and counteract him. Such is the alternative.
One failing, the other must be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, Sir, when thus insisting, let it be understood
that I am not unmindful of any of my responsibilities
in this Chamber. Other duties may devolve upon me
hereafter. For the present I speak as a Senator, bound,
in the discharge of official duty, to do what he can for
the public good. As a Senator, I must be plain; nor
can I be constrained by the possibility that hereafter
I may be called to judge the President. I am called
to judge him now. The proposition that Congress
should go home compels me to judge him.</p>

<p>Unquestionably it is for the other House to initiate
the proceedings which shall bring the President to your
bar. But until then it is the right and duty of every
Senator to express himself freely with regard to his
conduct; nor can there be any limit to this latitude.
It is as broad as human thought. No future duty can
be a strait-jacket now. Because the President may
be impeached, the Senate is not obliged to be silent
with regard to him. The National Constitution is guilty
of no such absurdity. Until a Senator is sworn on the
trial of impeachment, according to the requirement of
the National Constitution, he is a Senator, free to criticize
any public functionary, from the President to the
humblest officer; and if either has so acted as to deserve
removal, there is no reason why he should not
say so. This is only according to the National Constitution
and common sense.</p>

<p>Now, since Andrew Johnson remains President and
he is not yet at your bar, I cannot doubt that we ought
to stay in our seats to encounter the evil proceeding
from him. We must meet him constantly, and not leave
the field unoccupied.</p>

<p>For this reason, simply and briefly stated, I object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
to the motion of the Senator from Ohio. If I had
powers of persuasion, I would use them all to induce
you to remain as a guard to the National Constitution
and a constabulary force for the Rebel States. Possibly
you may not like the office. But I doubt if any
of us can be better employed anywhere than in contributing
to the success of Reconstruction, and in preserving
peace throughout that distressed region of country.
Sitting in our seats here, we are a mighty police,
ready at the call of general or citizen, and also a terror
to the evil-doer.</p>

<p>Senators wish to leave. So do I. Nobody can wish
to leave more than myself. I suffer much from these
heats. I long to be at home. But I feel that it is
my duty to be here. All that I have felt before is now
intensified by the menace of this message. Hereafter
no Senator can say that he did not know what to expect.
He will not be taken by surprise. Here is distinct
and open notice that the President will do all
in his power to thwart your legislation and to arrest
a just Reconstruction. There he stands, a constant impediment
to peace, and an ally to the Rebellion. And
yet, knowing these things, it is proposed to go home
and leave him undisturbed master till winter.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sherman said: “It does seem to me a very strange thing that
a judge, by whose vote alone the President can be removed, should
declare that he must be removed. [Mr. Sumner said, “Or Congress
must stay here to watch him.”]… If the House of Representatives
desire to present an impeachment of any officer of the Government, I
am perfectly willing to stay and try him. No such case is presented.”
Mr. Buckalew, of Pennsylvania, said: “The Senator from Massachusetts
who first spoke [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sumner</span>] maintains his usual position at the
end of this session. I do not remember any occasion when that member
supported a resolution of adjournment. I do not remember an occasion
when he did not vote for reassembling, when the opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
was afforded him, at an early date. In fact, I suspect, that, if the
truth were known, the Senator from Massachusetts would be prepared
with business the whole three hundred and sixty-five days of the year,
and that, if we consulted his views, we should make a French revolutionary
assemblage of the two Houses of Congress,&mdash;we should be in
permanent session, without vacation and without recess.” He insisted
that “we should withhold ourselves from the expression of judgment
upon a question which is not here, and which cannot come here, unless
it be brought here by the House of Representatives, over whose
action we have no control.” This brought up Mr. Sumner again.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;There is just the point. The Senator
says the question is not here,&mdash;in other words,
that this is not the time to discuss the President. He
is mistaken; this is the very time. The question is here
at the instance of the Senator from Ohio, who gravely
moves that we leave our seats, and from this time forward
till December abdicate our constitutional guardianship
of the public interests. To such a proposition
there is but one natural and logical reply. It is, that
we must not abdicate, so long as Andrew Johnson is
in the Executive chair. If he continues President, we
must remain at our posts, precisely as Grant remained
before Richmond.</p>

<p>Sir, if another person wielded the Executive powers
of the nation, if there was anybody in that high office
mindful of the National Constitution as interpreted by
the Declaration of Independence, and disposed to carry
forward the Acts of Congress adopted by such triumphant
majorities, then I could vote with Senators
to go home. Unhappily, it is not so. Anything but
this. Our President is a public enemy, successor in
spirit and opinion of Jefferson Davis, through whom
the Rebellion is once more on its legs. Does any Senator,
accustomed to vote with the Union party and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
sustain the Union cause, question this simple statement
of fact? Does he believe it overdrawn? Let him answer,
if he does. Let him say where my language goes
by a hair’s breadth beyond the exact truth.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Here Mr. Sumner stopped for answer, and then proceeded.</p>

</div>

<p>Because we have the successor of Jefferson Davis
in the Presidential chair, therefore Congress must stay.
That is my argument. A volume or oration could not
add to the force of this simple statement.</p>

<p>The more I think of this duty, the more commanding
it seems. The President is the Executive; we are
the Legislative. His influence is great; but ours is
greater. If we choose to say so, we can be masters.
We can apply the corrective to his mischief. Surely
here is a motive. Ten States are now exposed to his
malign influence, all of which may be arrested by our
presence here. Let it be known that we are to continue
in our seats, and every Union man throughout
the Rebel States will feel stronger. He will be conscious
at once of a panoply, which the President, and
the Rebel tail, of which he is the head, cannot penetrate.</p>

<p>There are the generals, also, who, as soon as we are
gone, may be his victims. The telegraph may flash to
us, in the comfort of home, that the gallant Sheridan,
as true in government as he was skilful in war, has
been driven from his post by an enemy with whom he
could not contend. It may flash the removal of Pope,
who has shown such talent and thoroughness in the
organization of his district, and also the displacement
of Sickles, who has carried into his new duties such varied
experience and patriotic purposes. All this may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
occur; for the President is vindictive in his assault upon
the upholders of Human Rights. Is it not worth our
care to provide against such calamity? But you propose
to go home and leave all, whether citizen or general,
a prey to the President. I protest against it.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment of Mr. Sumner was rejected. That of Mr. Sherman
was adopted, and the resolution as amended was then agreed
to,&mdash;Yeas 23, Nays 14. On the report of a Committee of Conference,
it was amended again by making the adjournment to “the 21st day
of November next,” which was adopted by the Senate,&mdash;Yeas 17,
Nays 14,&mdash;Mr. Sumner voting in the negative.</p>

<p><i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of

<p>These two resolutions gave expression to the sentiments of the American
people, who sympathized strongly in the Cretan struggle for independence.
For a time the courage and determination of the insurgents
inspired confidence, and it seemed as if they would prevail; but, after
a protracted struggle, they succumbed to superior force. The following
contemporary account is from the Washington correspondent of the
<i>Boston Journal</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner’s resolutions appealing to the Turkish Government in behalf
of Crete, which were passed by both Houses of Congress, have been
much spoken of in diplomatic circles. Some think they were too late,
as in their opinion the Cretans are already vanquished. This is not the
opinion with the Greek Legation, who is very hopeful, and insists that
the Turks can never prevail. The resolutions themselves, even among
those who do not sympathize with their object, are regarded as a masterpiece
of composition, inasmuch as, while very strong, they did not fail
in courtesy toward the Turkish Government. There was a great pressure
to have the independence of Crete acknowledged, especially by the
Greek Legation, and by friends of the Cretans in Massachusetts; but Mr.
Sumner took the ground that independence was a fact to be determined
by evidence, and that, whatever might be the opinion of individuals with
regard to the future result, there was no official evidence showing that
independence was yet established.”</p>

<p>The misconduct of the President, and his obstruction of important
legislation, naturally aroused judgment and indignation. The question
was then raised with regard to the privileges of the Senate. July
20th, in the debate on adjournment, Mr. Fessenden, of Maine, said:
“The time has come, undoubtedly, when there is a very serious difference
of opinion in Congress upon a very important question. With
regard to the Senate, I have considered that upon that question it
was not proper for a Senator to express an opinion, or even, if he
could avoid it, to form an opinion.” Mr. Sumner never doubted the
complete immunity of the Senate, and its duty to consider these things
in advance of impeachment, and he spoke accordingly. On the day of
Mr. Fessenden’s remarks he offered the following resolutions, which
were ordered to be printed.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Resolutions declaring the privileges of debate in the Senate
with regard to civil officers liable to impeachment.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Whereas it has been asserted that the conduct
of a civil officer liable to impeachment cannot
be freely considered and condemned by Senators in the
course of legislative proceedings;</p>

<p>And whereas such an opinion is calculated to impair
the just privileges of debate: Therefore,</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the Constitution, in providing for the
impeachment of “all civil officers” of the National
Government, embracing the President, members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Cabinet, diplomatic representatives, and other civil functionaries,
did not intend to limit debate in the Senate
on the conduct of any civil officer, so far as the same
may arise in legislative proceedings; that any other
interpretation is inconsistent with the privileges of the
Senate, and tends directly to shield misconduct in civil
office.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the Constitution expressly declares,
that, when sitting to try an impeachment, the Senate
“shall be on oath or affirmation,” thus superadding a
judicial oath to that already taken as Senator; that
from the taking of this oath the judicial character of
the Senate begins, and until then each Senator is free
to express himself openly on the conduct of any civil
officer, and thereupon to invite the judgment of the
Senate and the country; that at times this may be a

<p>History shows that the civilization to which we belong is subject to a
general law which makes it advance with halts, in the manner of armies,
in the direction of the Occident, making the sceptre pass successively into
the hands of nations more worthy to hold it, more strong and more able
to employ it for the general good.</p>

<p>So it seems that the supreme authority is about to escape from Western
and Central Europe, to pass to the New World. In the northern part of
that other hemisphere offshoots of the European race have founded a vigorous
society full of sap, whose influence grows with a rapidity that has
never yet been seen anywhere. In crossing the ocean, it has left behind
on the soil of old Europe traditions, prejudices, and usages, which, as
<i>impedimenta</i> heavy to carry, would have embarrassed its movements and
retarded its progressive march. In about thirty years the United States
will have, according to all probability, a hundred millions of population, in
possession of the most powerful means, distributed over a territory which
would make France fifteen or sixteen times over, and of the most wonderful
disposition.…</p>

<p class="dropcap">The discovery of America by Christopher Columbus
is the greatest event of secular history. Besides
the potato, the turkey, and maize, which it introduced
at once for the nourishment and comfort of the Old
World,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and also tobacco, which only blind passion for
the weed could place in the beneficent group, this discovery
opened the door to influences infinite in extent
and beneficence. Measure them, describe them, picture
them, you cannot. While yet unknown, imagination
invested this continent with proverbial magnificence.
It was the Orient, and the land of Cathay. When afterwards
it took a place in geography, imagination found
another field in trying to portray its future history. If
the Golden Age is before, and not behind, as is now
happily the prevailing faith, then indeed must America
share, at least, if it does not monopolize, the promised
good.</p>

<p>Before the voyage of Columbus in 1492, nothing of
America was really known. Scanty scraps from antiquity,
vague rumors from the resounding ocean, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
hesitating speculations of science were all that the inspired
navigator found to guide him. Foremost among
these were the well-known verses of Seneca, so interesting
from ethical genius and a tragical death, in the chorus
of his “Medea,” which for generations had been the
finger-point to an undiscovered world:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent8">“Venient annis</div>

<p>These verses are vague and lofty rather than specific;
but Bacon, after setting them forth, says of them, “A
prophecy of the discovery of America”; and this they
may well be, if we adopt the translation of Archbishop
Whately, in his notes to the Essay on Prophecies:
“There shall come a time in later ages, when Ocean
shall relax his chains and a vast continent appear, and
a pilot shall find new worlds, and Thule shall be no
more earth’s bound.”<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Fox, turning from statesmanship
to scholarship, wrote to Wakefield: “The prophecy
in Seneca’s ‘Medea’ is very curious indeed.”<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Irving
says of it: “Wonderfully apposite, and shows, at least,
how nearly the warm imagination of a poet may approach
to prophecy. The predictions of the ancient
oracles were rarely so unequivocal.”<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> These verses
were adopted by Irving as a motto on the title-page
of the revised edition of his “Life of Columbus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>This sympathetic and authoritative commentator, who
has illustrated the enterprise with all that classical or
mediæval literature affords, declares his conviction that
the discovery of a new continent was more completely
foreshadowed in the simple geographical statement of
the Greek Strabo,<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> who, after a long life of travel, sat
down in his old age, during the reign of Augustus, to
write the geography of the world, including its cosmography.
In this work, where are gathered the results of
ancient study and experience, the venerable author, after
alluding to the possibility of passing direct from Spain
to India, and explaining that the inhabited world is
that which we inhabit and know, thus lifts the curtain:
“There may be in the same temperate zone <em>two and indeed
more inhabited lands</em>, especially near the parallel of
Thinæ or Athens, prolonged into the Atlantic Ocean.”<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>

<p>Before the voyage of Columbus two Italian poets
seem to have beheld the unknown world. The first
was Petrarca; nor was it unnatural that his exquisite
genius should reach behind the veil of Time, as where
he pictures</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The daylight hastening with wingèd steps,</div>
<div class="verse">Perchance to gladden the expectant eyes</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The other was Pulci, who, in his “Morgante Maggiore,”
sometimes called the last of the romances and the earliest
of Italian epics, reveals an undiscovered world beyond
the Pillars of Hercules:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Know that this theory is false; his bark</div>

<p>This translation is by our own eminent historian,
Prescott, who first called attention to the testimony,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
which is not mentioned even by Humboldt. Leigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
Hunt referred to it at a later day.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Pulci was born in
1431, and died about 1487, five years before Columbus
sailed; so that he was not aided by any rumor of the
discovery he so distinctly predicts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Passing from the great event which gave a new world
not only to Spain, but to civilized man, it may not be
uninteresting to collect some of the prophetic voices
concerning the future of America and the vast unfolding
of our continent. They will have a lesson also.
Seeing what has been fulfilled, we may better judge
what to expect. I shall set them forth in the order
of time, prefacing each prediction with an account of
the author sufficient to explain its origin and character.
If some are already familiar, others are little known.
Brought together in one body, on the principle of our
National Union, <i>E pluribus unum</i>, they must give new
confidence in the destinies of the Republic.</p>

<p>Only what has been said sincerely by those whose
words are important deserves place in such a collection.
Oracles had ceased before our history began; so that we
meet no responses paltering in a double sense, like the
deceptive replies to Crœsus and to Pyrrhus, nor any
sayings which, according to the quaint language of Sir
Thomas Browne, “seem quodlibetically constituted, and,
like a Delphian blade, will cut on both sides.”<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> In Bacon’s
Essay on Prophecies there is a latitude not to be
followed. Not fable or romance, but history, is the true
authority; and here experience and genius are the lights
by which our prophets have walked. Doubtless there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
is a difference in human faculties. Men who have lived
much and felt strongly see further than others. Their
vision penetrates the future. Second-sight is little more
than clearness of sight. Milton tells us that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent4">“Old experience doth attain</div>
<div class="verse">To something like prophetic strain.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Sometimes this strain is attained even in youth. But
here Genius with divine power lifts the curtain and
sweeps the scene.</p>

<p>The elder Disraeli, in his “Curiosities of Literature,”
has a chapter on “Prediction,” giving curious instances,
among which is that of Rousseau, toward the end of
the third book of “Émile,” where he says, “We approach
a condition of crisis and the age of revolutions.”<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
Our own Revolution was then at hand, soon followed
by that of France. The settlement of America was not
without auguries even at the beginning.</p>

<h4>A PROPHETIC GROUP.</h4>

<p>Before passing to the more serious examples, I bring
into group a few marking at least a poet’s appreciation
of the newly discovered country, if not a prophetic
spirit. The Muse was not silent at the various reports.
As early as 1595, Chapman, famous as the translator of
Homer, in a poem on Guiana, thus celebrates and commends
the unknown land:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Guiana, whose rich feet are mines of gold,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose forehead knocks against the roof of stars,</div>
<div class="verse">Stands on her tiptoes, at fair England looking,</div>
<div class="verse">Kissing her hand, bowing her mighty breast,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
<div class="verse">And every sign of all submission making,</div>
<div class="verse">To be her sister, and the daughter both</div>
<div class="verse">Of our most sacred Maid.</div>
<div class="verse center">…</div>
<div class="verse">And there do palaces and temples rise</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the earth and kiss the enamored skies,</div>
<div class="verse">Where New Britannia humbly kneels to Heaven,</div>
<div class="verse">The world to her, and both at her blest feet</div>
<div class="verse">In whom the circles of all empire meet.”<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In similar strain, Drayton, who flourished under James
the First, says of Virginia:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2">“And ours to hold</div>
<div class="verse">Virginia,</div>
<div class="verse">Earth’s only paradise.</div>

<div class="verse">“Where Nature hath in store</div>
<div class="verse">Fowl, venison, and fish,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And the fruitfull’st soil,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Without your toil,</div>
<div class="verse">Three harvests more,</div>
<div class="verse">All greater than your wish.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse center">…</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“To whose the Golden Age</div>
<div class="verse">Still Nature’s laws doth give,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">No other cares that ’tend</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But them to defend</div>
<div class="verse">From winter’s age,</div>
<div class="verse">That long there doth not live.”<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Daniel, poet-laureate and contemporary, seemed to
foresee the spread of our English speech, anticipating
our own John Adams:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“And who (in time) knows whither we may vent</div>
<div class="verse">The treasure of our tongue? To what strange shores</div>
<div class="verse">This gain of our best glory shall be sent,</div>
<div class="verse">T’ enrich unknowing nations with our stores?</div>
<div class="verse">What worlds, in th’ yet unformèd Occident,</div>
<div class="verse">May come refined with th’ accents that are ours?”<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>
<p>The emigration prompted by conscience and for the
sake of religious liberty inspired the pious and poetical
Herbert to famous verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Religion stands on tiptoe in our land,</div>
<div class="verse">Ready to pass to the American strand.”<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The poet died in 1632, twelve years after the landing
of the Pilgrims at Plymouth, and only two years after
the larger movement of the Massachusetts Company,
which began the settlement of Boston. The verses saw
the light with difficulty, being refused the necessary
license; but the functionary at last yielded, calling
the author “a divine poet,” and expressing the hope
that “the world will not take him to be an inspired
prophet.”<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Fuller, writing a little later, was perhaps
moved by Herbert, when he said: “I am confident
that America, though the youngest sister of the four,
is now grown marriageable, and daily hopes to get
Christ to her husband by the preaching of the Gospel.”<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
In a different vein, a contemporary poet, the
favorite of Charles the First, Thomas Carew, in a
masque performed by the monarch and his courtiers
at Whitehall, February 18, 1633, made sport of New
England, saying that it had “purged more virulent
humors from the politic body than guaiacum and all
the West Indian drugs have from the natural bodies
of this kingdom.”<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> But these words uttered at the
English Court were praise.</p>

<p>Then came answering voices from the Colonies. Rev.
William Morrell, of the Established Church, a settler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
of 1623, said of New England, in a Latin poem translated
by himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“<em>A grandchild to Earth’s paradise is born</em>,</div>
<div class="verse">Well-limbed, well-nerved, fair, rich, sweet, yet forlorn.”<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The Simple Cobbler of Agawam,” another name for
Rev. Nathaniel Ward, of Ipswich, Mass., at the close of
his witty book, first published in 1647, and having four
different editions in this single year, sends an invitation
to those at home:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“So farewell, England Old!</div>
<div class="verse indent2">If evil times ensue,</div>
<div class="verse">Let good men come to us,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">We’ll welcome them to New.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another witness we meet in the writings of Franklin.
It is George Webb, who, decamping from Oxford and
the temptations of scholarship, indented himself according
to the usage of the times, and became what Franklin
calls “a bought servant” on our shores, where his
genius flowered in the prophetic couplet, written in
1727:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Europe shall mourn her ancient fame declined,</div>
<div class="verse"><em>And Philadelphia be the Athens of mankind</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another, Gulian Verplanck, of New York, in verses
written in England in 1773, foretells the repetition of
British wealth, power, and glory in the New World:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“In other worlds another Britain see,</div>
<div class="verse">And what thou art America shall be.”<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And yet another, Hugh Henry Brackenridge, born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
in Scotland, and a graduate of our Princeton College
in 1771, in a Commencement poem on “The Rising
Glory of America,” pictured the future of the continent,
adopting as a motto the verses of Seneca twice
quoted by Columbus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“This is thy praise, America, thy power,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou best of climes by Science visited,</div>
<div class="verse">By Freedom blest, and richly stored with all</div>
<div class="verse">The luxuries of life! Hail, happy land,</div>
<div class="verse">The seat of empire, the abode of kings,</div>
<div class="verse">The final stage where Time shall introduce</div>
<div class="verse">Renownèd characters, and glorious works</div>
<div class="verse">Of high invention and of wondrous art,</div>
<div class="verse">Which not the ravages of Time shall waste,</div>
<div class="verse">Till he himself has run his long career!”<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To these add Voltaire, who, in his easy verse, written
in 1751, represents God as putting fever in European
climates, “and the remedy in America.”<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>From this chorus, with only one discordant voice, I
pass to a long line of voices so distinct and full as to
be recognized separately.</p>

<h4>JOHN MILTON, 1641.</h4>

<p>The list opens with John Milton, whose lofty words
are like an overture to the great drama of emigration,
with its multitudes in successive generations. If not
a prophet, he has yet struck a mighty key-note in our
history.</p>

<p>The author of “Paradise Lost,” of “Comus,” and the
heroic Sonnets, needs no special mention beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
two great dates of birth and death. He was born 9th
December, 1608, and died 8th November, 1674. The
treatise from which I quote was written in 1641.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What numbers of faithful and free-born Englishmen and
good Christians have been constrained to forsake their dearest
home, their friends and kindred, whom nothing but the
wide ocean and the savage deserts of America could hide and
shelter from the fury of the bishops! Oh, Sir, if we could
but see the shape of our dear mother England, as poets are
wont to give a personal form to what they please, how would
she appear, think ye, but in a mourning weed, with ashes
upon her head and tears abundantly flowing from her eyes,
to behold so many of her children exposed at once and
thrust from things of dearest necessity, because their conscience
could not assent to things which the bishops thought
indifferent?… Let the astrologer be dismayed at the portentous
blaze of comets and impressions in the air, as foretelling
troubles and changes to states; I shall believe there
cannot be a more ill-boding sign to a nation (God turn the
omen from us!) than when the inhabitants, to avoid insufferable
grievances at home, are enforced by heaps to forsake
their native country.”<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here in a few words are the sacrifices made by our
fathers, as they turned from their English homes, and
also the conscience which prompted and sustained them.
Begun in sacrifice and in conscience, their empire grew
and flourished with constant and increasing promise of
future grandeur.</p>

<h4>ABRAHAM COWLEY, 1667.</h4>

<p>Contemporary with Milton, and at the time a rival
for the palm of poetry, was Abraham Cowley, born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
1618, died 28th July, 1667. His biography stands at
the head of Johnson’s “Lives of the English Poets,”
the first in that instructive collection. The two poets
were on opposite sides,&mdash;Milton for the Commonwealth,
Cowley for the King.</p>

<p>His genius was recognized in his own time; and when
he died, at the age of forty-nine, after a night of exposure
under the open sky, Charles the Second said, “Mr.
Cowley has not left a better man behind him in England.”
He was buried in Westminster Abbey, near
Chaucer and Spenser.</p>

<p>He composed, in much-admired Latin verse, six books
on Plants: the first and second in elegiac verse, displaying
the qualities of herbs; the third and fourth
in various measures, on the beauties of flowers; and
the fifth and sixth in hexameters, like the Georgics, on
the uses of trees. The first two books, in Latin, appeared
in 1662; the other four, also in Latin, were not
published till 1668, the year after his death. They
did not see the English light till near the close of
the century, when a translation was published by Tate,
from which I quote.</p>

<p>Two fruits of America are commemorated. The first
is that which becomes Chocolate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Guatimala produced a fruit unknown</div>
<div class="verse">To Europe, which with pride she called her own:</div>
<div class="verse">Her Cacao-Nut, with double use endued,</div>
<div class="verse">(For Chocolate at once is drink and food,)</div>
<div class="verse">Does strength and vigor to the limbs impart,</div>
<div class="verse">Makes fresh the countenance and cheers the heart.”<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The other is the Cocoa-Nut:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“While she preserves this Indian palm alone,</div>
<div class="verse">America can never be undone;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Embowelled, and of all her gold bereft,</div>
<div class="verse">Her liberty and Coccus only left,</div>
<div class="verse">She’s richer than the Spaniard with his theft.”<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The poet, addressing the New World, becomes prophetic:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“To live by wholesome laws you now begin,</div>
<div class="verse">Buildings to raise, and fence your cities in,</div>
<div class="verse">To plough the earth, to plough the very main,</div>

<div class="verse">Defensive arms, and ornaments of dress,</div>
<div class="verse">All implements of life, you now possess.</div>

<div class="verse">In vain, while foreign and domestic war</div>
<div class="verse">At once shall her distracted bosom tear,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Forlorn, and to be pitied even by you.</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Meanwhile your rising glory you shall view;</em></div>
<div class="verse"><em>Wit, learning, virtue, discipline of war,</em></div>
<div class="verse"><em>Shall for protection to your world repair,</em></div>
<div class="verse"><em>And fix a long illustrious empire there.</em></div>
<div class="verse center">…</div>
<div class="verse">“Late Destiny shall high exalt your reign,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose pomp no crowds of slaves, a needless train,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor gold, the rabble’s idol, shall support,</div>
<div class="verse">Like Motezume’s or Guanapaci’s court,</div>
<div class="verse">But such true grandeur as old Rome maintained,</div>
<div class="verse">Where Fortune was a slave, and Virtue reigned.”<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This prophecy, though appearing in English tardily,
may be dated from 1667, when the Latin poem was
already written.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<h4>SIR THOMAS BROWNE, 1682.</h4>

<p>Dr. Johnson called attention to a tract of Sir Thomas
Browne entitled “A Prophecy concerning the Future
State of Several Nations,” where the famous author
“plainly discovers his expectation to be the same with
that entertained lately with more confidence by Dr.
Berkeley, <em>that America will be the seat of the fifth empire</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
The tract is vague, but prophetic.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Browne was born 19th October, 1605,
and died 19th October, 1682. His tract was published
two years after his death, in a collection of Miscellanies,
edited by Dr. Tenison. As a much-admired
author, some of whose writings belong to our English
classics, his prophetic prolusions are not unworthy of
notice. Among them are the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“When New England shall trouble New Spain;</div>
<div class="verse">When Jamaica shall be lady of the isles and the main;</div>

<p>Some of these words are striking, especially when we
consider their early date. In a commentary on each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
verse the author seeks to explain it. New England is
“that thriving colony which hath so much increased
in our days”; its people are already “industrious,” and
when they have so far increased “that the neighboring
country will not contain them, they will range still
farther, and be able in time to set forth great armies,
seek for new possessions, or <em>make considerable and conjoined
migrations</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> The verse touching Africa will be
fulfilled “when African countries shall no longer make
it a common trade to sell away their people.” And
this may come to pass “whenever they shall be well
civilized, and acquainted with arts and affairs sufficient
to employ people in their countries: if also they should
be converted to Christianity, but especially unto Mahometism;
for then they would never sell those of their
religion to be slaves unto Christians.”<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> The verse concerning
America is expounded thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That is, When America shall be better civilized, new
policied, and divided between great princes, it may come to
pass that they will no longer suffer their treasure of gold
and silver to be sent out to maintain the luxury of Europe
and other parts; but rather employ it to their own advantages,
in great exploits and undertakings, magnificent structures,
wars, or expeditions of their own.”<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The other verse, on the invasion of the Old World
by the New, is explained:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That is, When America shall be so well peopled, civilized,
and divided into kingdoms, <em>they are like to have so
little regard of their originals as to acknowledge no subjection
unto them</em>: they may also have a distinct commerce between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
themselves, or but independently with those of Europe, and
may hostilely and piratically assault them, even as the Greek
and Roman colonies after a long time dealt with their original
countries.”<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

</div>

<p>That these speculations should arrest the attention of
Dr. Johnson is something. They seem to have been
in part fulfilled. An editor quietly remarks, that, “to
judge from the course of events since Sir Thomas wrote,
we may not unreasonably look forward to their more
complete fulfilment.”<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<h4>SIR JOSIAH CHILD AND DR. CHARLES DAVENANT, 1698.</h4>

<p>In contrast with the poets, but mingling with them
in forecast, were two writers on Trade, who saw the
future through facts and figures, or what one of them
called “political arithmetic,” even discerning colonial
independence in the distance. These were Sir Josiah
Child, born 1630 and died 1699, and Dr. Charles Davenant,
born 1656 and died 1714.</p>

<p>Child is mentioned by De Foe as “originally a
tradesman”; others speak of him as “a Southwalk
brewer”; and McCulloch calls him “one of the most
extensive, and, judging from his work, best-informed,
merchants of his time.”<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> He rose to wealth and consideration,
founding a family which intermarried with
the nobility. His son was known as Lord Castlemaine,
Earl Tylney, of Ireland. Davenant was eldest son of
“rare Sir William,” the author of “Gondibert,” and,
like his eminent father, a dramatist. He was also
member of Parliament, and wrote much on commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
questions; but here he was less famous than Child,
whose “New Discourse of Trade,” so far as it concerned
the interest of money, first appeared in 1668,
and since then has been often reprinted and much
quoted. There was an enlarged edition in 1694. That
now before me appeared in 1698, and in the same
year Davenant published his kindred “Discourses on
the Public Revenues and on the Trade of England,”
among which is one “on the Plantation Trade.” The
two authors treated especially the Colonies, and in
similar spirit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The work of Child was brought to more recent notice
by the voluminous plodder, George Chalmers, particularly
in his writings on the Colonies and American
Independence,<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and then again by the elder Disraeli,
in his “Curiosities of Literature,” who places a prophecy
attributed to him in his chapter on “Prediction.”
After referring to Harrington, “who ventured to predict
an event, not by other similar events, but by a theoretical
principle which he had formed,” and to a like error
in De Foe, Disraeli quotes Chalmers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Child, foreseeing from experience that men’s conduct
must finally be decided [directed] by their principles, foretold
the colonial revolt. De Foe, allowing his prejudices to
obscure his sagacity, reprobated that suggestion, because he
deemed interest a more strenuous prompter than enthusiasm.”</p>

</div>

<p>The pleasant hunter of curiosities then says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The predictions of Harrington and De Foe are precisely
such as we might expect from a petty calculator,&mdash;a political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
economist, who can see nothing farther than immediate
results; but the true philosophical predictor was Child, who
had read <em>the past</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Disraeli was more curious than accurate. His excuse
is, that he followed another writer.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The prediction
attributed to Child belongs to Davenant.</p>

<p>The work of Child is practical rather than speculative,
and shows a careful student of trade. Dwelling
on the “plantations” of England and their value, he
considers their original settlement, and here we find a
painful contrast between New England and Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
Passing from the settlement to the character, New
England is described as “being a more independent
government from this kingdom than any other of our
plantations, and the people that went thither more
one peculiar sort or sect than those that went to the
rest of our plantations.”<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> He recognized in them “a
people whose frugality, industry, and temperance, and
the happiness of whose laws and institution, do promise
to themselves long life, with <em>a wonderful increase
of people, riches, and power</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> And then: “Of all the
American plantations, his Majesty hath none so apt
for the building of shipping as New England, nor
none comparably so qualified for breeding of seamen,
not only by reason of the natural industry of that people,
but principally by reason of their cod and mackerel
fisheries.”<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> On his last page are words more than
complimentary:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To conclude this chapter, and to do right to that most
industrious English colony, I must confess, that, though we
lose by their unlimited trade with our foreign plantations,
yet we are very great gainers by their direct trade to and
from Old England: our yearly exportations of English
manufactures, malt, and other goods, from hence thither,
amounting, in my opinion, to ten times the value of what
is imported from thence.”<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here is keen observation, but hardly prophecy.</p>

<p>Contrast this with Davenant:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As the case now stands, we shall show that they [the
Colonies] are a spring of wealth to this nation, that they
work for us, that their treasure centres all here, and that
the laws have tied them fast enough to us; so that it
must be through our own fault and misgovernment, <em>if they
become independent of England</em>.… Corrupt governors by
oppressing the inhabitants may hereafter provoke them to
withdraw their obedience, and by supine negligence or upon
mistaken measures we may let them grow, more especially
New England, in naval strength and power, <em>which if suffered,
we cannot expect to hold them long in our subjection</em>.
If, as some have proposed, we should think to build ships
of war there, we may teach them an art which will cost
us some blows to make them forget. Some such courses
may, indeed, drive them, or put it into their heads, <em>to erect
themselves into independent Commonwealths</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Davenant then, following Child, remarks upon New
England as “the most proper for building ships and
breeding seamen,” and adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So that, if we should go to cultivate among them the
art of navigation and teach them to have a naval force, <i>they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
may set up for themselves and make the greatest part of our
West India trade precarious</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These identical words are quoted by Chalmers, who
exclaims: “Of that prophecy we have lived, alas! to
see the fulfilment.”<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>Chalmers emigrated from Scotland to Maryland, and
practised in the colonial courts, but, disgusted with
American independence, returned home, where he wrote
and edited much, especially on colonial questions, ill
concealing a certain animosity, and on one occasion
stating that among the documents in the Board of
Trade and Paper Office were “the most satisfactory
proofs of the settled purpose of the revolted colonies,
from the epoch of the Revolution in 1688, to acquire
direct independence.”<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> But none of these proofs are
presented. The same allegation was also made by
Viscount Bury in his “Exodus of the Western Nations,”<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
but also without proofs.</p>

<p>The name of De Foe is always interesting, and I
cannot close this article without reference to the saying
attributed to him by Chalmers. I know not where
in his multitudinous writings it may be found, unless
in his “Plan of the English Commerce,” and here careful
research discloses nothing nearer than this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What a glorious trade to England it would be to have
those colonies increased with a million of people, to be
clothed, furnished, and supplied with all their needful
things, food excepted, only from us, and <i>tied down forever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
to us by that immortal, indissoluble bond of trade, their interest</i>!”<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the same work he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This is certain, and will be granted, that the product of
our improved colonies raises infinitely more trade, employs
more hands, and, I think I may say, by consequence, brings
in more wealth to this one particular nation or people, the
English, than all the mines of New Spain do to the Spaniards.”<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In this vision the author of “Robinson Crusoe” was
permitted to see the truth with regard to our country,
although failing to recognize future independence.</p>

<h4>BISHOP BERKELEY, 1726.</h4>

<p>It is pleasant to think that Berkeley, whose beautiful
verses predicting the future of America are so often
quoted, was so sweet and charming a character. Atterbury
said of him: “So much understanding, so much
knowledge, so much innocence, and such humility I did
not think had been the portion of any but angels, till I
saw this gentleman.”<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Swift said: “He is an absolute
philosopher with regard to money, titles, and power.”<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
Pope let drop a tribute which can never die:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“To Berkeley every virtue under Heaven.”<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Such a person was naturally a seer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>He is compendiously called an Irish prelate and
philosopher. Born in the County of Kilkenny, 1684,
and dying in Oxford, 1753, he began as a philosopher.
While still young, he wrote his famous treatise on “The
Principles of Human Knowledge,” where he denies the
existence of matter, insisting that it is only an impression
produced on the mind by Divine power. After
travel for several years on the Continent, and fellowship
with the witty and learned at home, among whom
were Addison, Swift, Pope, Garth, and Arbuthnot, he
conceived the project of educating the aborigines of
America, which was set forth in a tract, published in
1725, entitled “A Proposal for the better Supplying
of Churches in our Foreign Plantations, and for Converting
the Savage Americans to Christianity, by a
College to be erected in the Summer Islands, otherwise
called the Isles of Bermuda.” Persuaded by his
benevolence, the Minister<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> promised twenty thousand
pounds, and there were several private subscriptions,
to promote what was called by the King “so pious an
undertaking.” Berkeley possessed already a deanery in
Ireland, worth eleven hundred pounds a year. Turning
away from this residence, and refusing to be tempted
by an English mitre, offered by the Queen, he set sail
for Rhode Island, “which lay nearest to Bermuda,”
where, after a tedious passage of more than four
months, he arrived 23d January, 1729. Here he lived
on a farm back of Newport, having been, according
to his own report, “at very great expense in purchasing
land and stock.”<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> In familiar letters he has recorded
his impression of this place, famous since for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
fashion. “The climate,” he says, “is like that of Italy,
and not at all colder in the winter than I have known
it everywhere north of Rome.… This island is pleasantly
laid out in hills and vales and rising grounds,
hath plenty of excellent springs and fine rivulets, and
many delightful landscapes of rocks and promontories
and adjacent islands.… The town of Newport contains
about six thousand souls, and is the most thriving,
flourishing place in all America for its bigness. It
is very pretty, and pleasantly situated. I was never
more agreeably surprised than at the first sight of
the town and its harbor.”<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> He seems to have been
contented, and when his companions went to Boston
stayed at home, “preferring,” as he wrote, “quiet and
solitude to the noise of a great town, notwithstanding
all the solicitations that have been used to draw us
thither.”<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>The money he had expected, especially from the
King’s ministers, failed, and after waiting in vain expectation
two years and a half, he returned to England,
leaving an infant daughter buried in the churchyard
of Trinity, and bestowing upon Yale College a
library of eight hundred and eighty volumes, as well as
his estate in Rhode Island. During his residence at
Newport he preached every Sunday, and was indefatigable
in pastoral duties, besides meditating, if not
composing, “The Minute Philosopher,” which was published
shortly after his return.</p>

<p>In his absence he had not been forgotten at home;
and shortly after his return he became Bishop of
Cloyne, in which place he was most exemplary, devoting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
himself to his episcopal duties, to the education
of his children, and the pleasures of composition.</p>

<p>It was while occupied with his plan of a college, especially
as a nursery for the colonial churches, shortly
before sailing for America, that the great future was
revealed to him, and he wrote the famous poem, the
only one found among his works, entitled “Verses on the
Prospect of Planting Arts and Learning in America.”<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
The date may be fixed at 1726. Such a poem was an
historic event. I give the first and last stanzas.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The Muse, disgusted at an age and clime</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Barren of every glorious theme,</div>
<div class="verse"><em>In distant lands now waits a better time,</em></div>

<div class="verse indent2">Time’s noblest offspring is the last.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is difficult to exaggerate the value of these verses,
which have been so often quoted as to have become
a commonplace of literature and politics. There is
nothing from any oracle, there is very little from any
prophecy, which can compare with them. The biographer
of Berkeley, who wrote in the last century, was
very cautious, when, after calling them “a beautiful
copy of verses,” he says that “another age perhaps will
acknowledge the old conjunction of the prophetic character
with that of the poet to have again taken place.”<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
The <i>vates</i> of the Romans was poet and prophet; and
such was Berkeley.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster calls this an “extraordinary prophecy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>”
and then says: “It was an intuitive glance into futurity;
it was a grand conception, strong, ardent, glowing,
embracing all time since the creation of the world
and all regions of which that world is composed, and
judging of the future by just analogy with the past.
And the inimitable imagery and beauty with which
the thought is expressed, joined to the conception itself,
render it one of the most striking passages in our
language.”<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>The sentiment which prompted the prophetic verses
of the excellent Bishop was widely diffused, or perhaps
it was a natural prompting.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> Of this illustration is
afforded in the life of Benjamin West. On his visit to
Rome in 1760, the young artist encountered a famous
improvvisatore, who, learning that he was an American
come to study the fine arts in Rome, at once addressed
him with the ardor of inspiration, and to the music
of his guitar. After singing the darkness which for so
many ages veiled America from the eyes of Science, and
also the fulness of time when the purposes for which
this continent had been raised from the deep would be
manifest, he hailed the youth before him as an instrument
of Heaven to create there a taste for the arts
which elevate man, and an assurance of refuge to science
and knowledge, when, in the old age of Europe,
they should have forsaken her shores. Then, in the
spirit of prophecy, he sang:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<em>But all things of heavenly origin, like the glorious sun,
move westward</em>; and Truth and Art have their periods of
shining and of night. Rejoice, then, O venerable Rome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
in thy divine destiny! for, though darkness overshadow thy
seats, and though thy mitred head must descend into the
dust, <em>thy spirit, immortal and undecayed, already spreads
towards a new world</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

</div>

<p>John Adams, in his old age, dwelling on the reminiscences
of early life, records that nothing in his reading
was “more ancient in his memory than the observation
that arts, sciences, and empire had travelled westward,
and in conversation it was always added, since he was
a child, that their next leap would be over the Atlantic
into America.” With the assistance of an octogenarian
neighbor, he recalled a couplet which he had heard repeated
“for more than sixty years”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The Eastern nations sink, their glory ends,</div>
<div class="verse">And empire rises where the sun descends.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The tradition was, as his neighbor had heard it, that
these lines came from some of our early Pilgrims, by
whom they had been “inscribed, or rather drilled, into
a rock on the shore of Monument [Manomet] Bay in
our Old Colony of Plymouth.”<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>Another illustration of this same sentiment is found
in Burnaby’s “Travels through the Middle Settlements
in North America, in 1759 and 1760,” a work first published
in 1775. In reflections at the close the traveller
remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“An idea, strange as it is visionary, has entered into the
minds of the generality of mankind, <em>that empire is travelling
westward; and every one is looking forward with eager and
impatient expectation to that destined moment when America
is to give law to the rest of the world</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>The traveller is none the less an authority for the
prevalence of this sentiment because he declares it “illusory
and fallacious,” and records his conviction that
“America is formed for happiness, but not for empire.”
Happy America! What empire can compare with happiness?
Making amends for this admission, the jealous
traveller, in his edition of 1798, after the adoption of
the National Constitution, announces “that the present
union of the American States will not be permanent,
or last for any considerable length of time,” and “that
that extensive country must necessarily be divided into
separate states and kingdoms.”<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Thus far the Union
has stood against all shocks, foreign or domestic; and
the prophecy of Berkeley is more than ever in the
popular mind.</p>

<h4>SAMUEL SEWALL, 1697-1727.</h4>

<p>Berkeley saw the sun of empire travelling westward.
A contemporary whose home was made in New England,
Samuel Sewall, saw the New Heaven and the
New Earth. He was born at Bishop-Stoke, England,
28th March, 1652, and died at Boston, 1st January,
1730. A child emigrant in 1661, he became a student
and graduate of our Cambridge; in 1692, Judge of the
Supreme Court of Massachusetts; in 1718, Chief Justice.
He was of the court which condemned the
witches, but afterwards, standing up before the congregation
of his church, made public confession of error,
and his secret diary bears testimony to his trial of conscience.
In harmony with this contrition was his early
feeling for the enslaved African, as witness his tract,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
“The Selling of Joseph,” so that he may be called the
first of our Abolitionists.</p>

<p>Besides an “Answer to Queries respecting America,”
in 1690, and “Proposals touching the Accomplishment
of Prophecies,” in 1713, he wrote another work, with
the following title:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Phænomena quædam Apocalyptica ad Aspectum Novi
Orbis configurata: Or, Some Few Lines towards a Description
of the New Heaven as it makes to those who stand
upon the New Earth. By Samuel Sewall, A. M., and sometime
Fellow of Harvard College at Cambridge in New England.”</p>

</div>

<p>The copy before me is the second edition, with the
imprint, “Massachuset, Boston. Printed by Bartholomew
Green, and sold by Benjamin Eliot, Samuel Gerrish,
and Daniel Henchman. 1727.” There is a prophetic
voice even in the title, which promises “some
few lines towards a description of the New Heaven as
it makes to those who stand upon the New Earth.”
This is followed by verses from the Scriptures, among
which is Isaiah, xi. 14: “But they shall fly upon the
shoulders of the Philistines toward the west”; also,
Acts, i. 8: “Ye shall be witnesses unto me unto the
uttermost part of the earth,”&mdash;quoting here from the
Spanish Bible, “<i>hasta lo ultimo de la tierra</i>.”</p>

<p>Two different Dedications follow,&mdash;the first dated
“Boston, N. E., April 16th, 1697.” Here are words
on the same key with the title:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For I can’t but think that either England or New England,
or both, (together is best,) is the only bridemaid mentioned
by name in David’s prophetical Epithalamium, to
assist at the great wedding now shortly to be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>.…
Angels incognito have sometimes made themselves guests to
men, designing thereby to surprise them with a requital of
their love to strangers. In like manner the English nation,
in showing kindness to the aboriginal natives of America,
may possibly show kindness to Israelites unawares.…
Instead of being branded for slaves with hot irons in the face
and arms, and driven by scores in mortal chains, they shall
wear the name of God in their foreheads, and they shall be
delivered into the glorious liberty of the children of God.…
Asia, Africa, and Europe have each of them had a
glorious Gospel-day. None, therefore, will be grieved at any
one’s pleading that America may be made coparcener with
her sisters in the free and sovereign grace of God.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the second Dedication the author speaks of his
book as “this vindication of America.”</p>

<p>Then comes, in black letter, what is entitled “Psalm
139, 7-10,” containing this stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Yea, let me take the morning wings,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And let me go and hide:</div>
<div class="verse">Even there where are the farthest parts,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Where flowing sea doth slide.</div>
<div class="verse">Yea, even thither also shall</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thy reaching hand me guide;</div>
<div class="verse">And thy right hand shall hold me fast,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And make me to abide.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Entering upon his subject, our prophet says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whereas New England, and Boston of the Massachusetts,
have this to make mention of, that they can tell their
age, and account it their honor to have their birth and
parentage kept in everlasting remembrance. And in very
deed, the families and churches which first ventured to follow
Christ thorow the Atlantic Ocean into a strange land full
of wild men were so religious, their end so holy, their self-denial
in pursuing of it so extraordinary, that I can’t but hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
that the plantation has thereby gained a very strong crasis,
and that it will not be of one or two or three centuries only,
but by the grace of God it will be very long lasting.”<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“New Jerusalem will not straiten and enfeeble, but wonderfully
dilate and invigorate Christianity in the several
quarters of the world,&mdash;in Asia, in Africa, in Europe, and
in America. And one that has been born, or but lived in
America more than threescore years, it may be pardonable for
him to ask, Why may not that be the place of New Jerusalem?”<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And here also:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Of all the parts of the world which do from this charter
entitle themselves to the government of Christ, America’s
plea, in my opinion, is the strongest. For when once Christopher
Columbus had added this fourth to the other three
parts of the foreknown world, they who sailed farther westward
arrived but where they had been before. The globe
now failed of offering anything new to the adventurous
traveller,&mdash;or, however, it could not afford another New
World. And probably the consideration of America’s being
<em>the beginning of the East and the end of the West</em> was
that which moved Columbus to call some part of it by the
name of Alpha and Omega. Now if the last Adam did give
order for the engraving of his own name upon this last earth,
’twill draw with it great consequences, even such as will in
time bring the poor Americans out of their graves and make
them live.”<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Again he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“May it not with more or equal strength be argued: New
Jerusalem is not the same with Jerusalem; but as Jerusalem
was to the westward of Babylon, so New Jerusalem must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
to the westward of Rome, to avoid disturbance in the order
of these mysteries?”<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then quoting Latin verses of Cowley<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> and English
verses of Herbert,<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> he says: “Not doubting but that
these authorities, being brought to the king’s scales,
will be over weight.”<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>Afterwards he adduces “learned Mr. Nicholas Fuller,”
who “would fain have it believed that America was
first peopled by the posterity of our great-grandfather
Japheth, though he will not be very strict with us as
to the particular branch of that wide family.”<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> The
extract from this new authority is remarkable for its
vindication to Columbus of the name of the new continent:
“Quam passim <em>Americam</em> dicunt, vere ac merito
<em>Columbinam</em> potius dicerent, a magnanimo heroë Christophoro
Columbo Genuensi, primo terrarum illarum investigatore
atque inventore plane divinitus constituto.”<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
This designation Fuller adopts: thus, “Hinc ergo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
<em>Columbina</em> primum”; and again, “Multo is quidem propior
est <em>Columbinæ</em>”; then again, “America, seu verius
<em>Columbina</em>”; and yet again, “Repertam fuisse <em>Columbinam</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>
This effort draws from our prophet a comment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But why should a learned man make all this <i>Dirige</i> for
Columbus’s name? What matter is it how America be
called? For Flavio of Malphi in Naples hath in great measure
applied the virtues of the loadstone to the mariner’s compass
in vain, the Portugals have found the length of Africa’s
foot in vain, the Spaniards sent out the Italian dove in vain,
Sir Francis Drake hath sailed round the world and made
thorow lights to it in vain, and Hakluyt and Purchas have
with endless labor acquainted Englishmen with these things
in vain, if, after all, we go about to turn the American Euphrates
into a Stygian Lake. The breaking of this one instrument
spoils us of the long-expected and much-desired
consort of music.”<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Very soon thereafter he breaks forth in words printed
in large Italic type and made prophetic:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Lift up your heads, O ye Gates</i> [of Columbina], <i>and
be ye lift up, ye Everlasting Doors, and the KING of
Glory shall come in</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

</div>

<h4>MARQUIS D’ARGENSON, 1733.</h4>

<p>From the Puritan son of New England, pass now to
a different character. René Louis de Voyer, Marquis
d’Argenson, a French noble, was born 18th October,
1694, and died 26th January, 1757; so that his life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
lapped upon the prolonged reigns of Louis the Fourteenth
and Louis the Fifteenth. At college the comrade
of Voltaire, he was ever afterwards the friend and
correspondent of this great writer. His own thoughts,
commended by the style of the other, would have placed
him among the most illustrious of French history. Notwithstanding
strange eccentricities, he was often elevated,
far-sighted, and prophetic, above any other Frenchman
except Turgot. By the courtiers of Versailles he
was called “the Stupid” (<i>la Bête</i>), while Voltaire hailed
one of his productions, yet in manuscript, as the “work
of Aristides,” and pronounced him “the best citizen who
had ever reached the ministry,” and the Duc de Richelieu
called him “Secretary of State for the Republic of
Plato.”<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>Except a brief subordinate service and two years of
the Cabinet as Minister of Foreign Affairs, his life was
passed in meditation and composition, especially on subjects
of government and human improvement. This
was his great passion. “If I were in power,” he wrote,
“and knew a capable man, I would go on all fours and
seek him, to pray him to serve me as counsellor and tutor.”<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
Is not this a lesson to the heedless partisan?</p>

<p>In 1725 he became an active member of a small club
devoted to hardy speculation, and known, from its place
of meeting at the apartment of its founder, as <i>l’Entre-Sol</i>.
It is to his honor that he mingled here with the
Abbé Saint-Pierre, and sympathized entirely with the
many-sided, far-sighted plans of this “good man.” In
the privacy of his journal he records his homage: “This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
worthy citizen is not known, and he does not know
himself.… He has much intelligence, and has devoted
himself to a kind of philosophy profound and
abandoned by everybody, which is the true politics destined
to procure the greatest happiness of men.”<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> In
praising Saint-Pierre our author furnished a measure
of himself.</p>

<p>His “Considérations sur le Gouvernement Ancien et
Présent de la France,” a work which excited the admiration
both of Voltaire and Rousseau, was read by the
former as early as 1739, but did not see the light till
some years after the death of the author. It first appeared
at Amsterdam in 1764, and in a short time there
were no less than four editions in Holland. In 1784 a
more accurate edition appeared in France, and in 1787
another at the command and expense of the Assembly
of Notables. Here was a recognition of the people, and
an inquiry how far democracy was consistent with monarchical
government. Believing much in the people and
anxious for their happiness, he had not ceased to believe
in kings. The book was contained in the epigraph from
the “Britannicus” of Racine:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent4">“Que dans le cours d’un règne florissant,</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Rome soit toujours libre</em>, et César tout-puissant.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Other works followed: “Essays in the Style of those
of Montaigne”; and the “Journal and Memoirs,” in nine
volumes, published tardily. There still remain in manuscript:
“Remarks while Reading”; “Memoirs of State”;
“Foreign Affairs, containing Memoirs of my Ministry”;
“Thoughts since my Leaving the Ministry”; and especially,
“Thoughts on the Reformation of the State.” In
all these there is a communicativeness like that of Saint-Simon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
in his “Memoirs,” and of Rousseau in his “Confessions,”
without the wonderful talent of either. The
advanced ideas of the author are constantly conspicuous,
making him foremost among contemporaries in discerning
the questions of the future. Even of marriage he
writes in the spirit of some modern reformers: “It is
necessary to press the people to marriage, <em>waiting for
something better</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> This is an instance. His reforms
embraced nothing less than the suppression of feudal
privileges and of the right of primogeniture, uniformity
of weights and measures, judges irremovable and salaried
by the State, the dismissal of foreign troops, and
the residence of the king and his ministers in the capital
embellished by vast squares, pierced by broad streets,
“with the <i>Bois de Boulogne</i> for country.” This is the
Paris of latter days. Add to this the suppression of
cemeteries, hospitals, and slaughter-houses in the interior
of Paris,&mdash;and many other things, not omitting
omnibuses, and even including balloons. “Here is
something,” he records, “which will be treated as folly.
I am persuaded that one of the first famous discoveries
to make, and reserved perhaps for our age, is to find the
art of flying in the air.” And he proceeds to describe
the balloon.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>His large nature is manifest in cosmopolitan ideas,
and the inquiry if it were not well to consider one’s self
“as citizen of the world” more than is the usage. Here
his soul glows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What a small corner Europe occupies on the round earth!
How many lands remain to be inhabited! See this immense
extent of three parts of the world, and of undiscovered lands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
at the North and South! If people went there with other
views than that tiresome exclusive property, all these lands
would be inhabited in two centuries. We shall not see this,
but it will come.”<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And then, after coupling morals and well-being, he
announces the true rule: “An individual who shall do
well will succeed, and who shall do ill will fail: <em>it is
the same with nations</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> This is just and lofty. In
such a spirit he cherished plans of political reconstruction
in foreign nations, especially in Italy. The old
Italian cry was his: “The Barbarians must be driven
from Italy”; and he contemplated “a republic or eternal
association of the Italian powers, as there was a
German, a Dutch, an Helvetic,” and he called this “the
greatest affair that had been treated in Europe for a
long time.” The entry of Italy was to be closed to
the Emperor; and he adds: “For ourselves what a
happy privation, if we are excluded forever from the
necessity of sending thither our armies to triumph, but
to perish!”<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>The intelligence that saw Italy so clearly saw France
also, and her exigencies, marking out “a national senate
composed equally of all the orders of the state, and
which, on questions of peace and war, would hold the
kings in check by the necessity of obtaining supplies”;
also saw the approaching decay of Turkey, and wished
to make Greece flourishing once more, to acquire possession
of the holy places, to overcome the barbarians of
Northern Africa by a union of Christian powers, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
“once well united in a kind of Christian Republic, according
to the project of Henry the Fourth detailed by
the Abbé Saint-Pierre, would have something better to
do than fighting to destroy each other as they now do.”<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
Naturally this singular precocious intelligence reached
across the Atlantic, and here he became one of our
prophets:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Another great event to arrive upon the round earth is
this. The English have in North America domains great,
strong, rich, well regulated. There are in New England a
parliament, governors, troops, white inhabitants in abundance,
riches, and, what is worse, a marine.</p>

<p>“I say that some fine morning these dominions may separate
from England, rise and erect themselves into an independent
republic.</p>

<p>“What will happen then? Do people think of this? A
country civilized by the arts of Europe, in a condition to
communicate with it by the present perfection of its marine,
and which will thus appropriate our arts in proportion to
their improvement,&mdash;patience! such a country in several
centuries will make great progress in population and in refinement;
such a country in a short time will render itself
master of America, and especially of the gold-mines.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then, dwelling on the extension of commercial freedom
and the improvement of the means of communication,
he exclaims, with lyrical outburst:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And you will then see how beautiful the earth will be!
what culture! what new arts and new sciences! what safety
for commerce! Navigation will precipitate all nations towards
each other. A day will come when one will go about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
in a populous and orderly city of California as one goes in the
stage-coach of Meaux.”<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The published works of D’Argenson do not enable us
to fix the precise date of these remarkable words. They
are from the “Thoughts on the Reformation of the
State,” and the first three paragraphs appear to have
been written as early at least as 1733, while his intimacy
with the Abbé Saint-Pierre was at its height; the
fourth somewhat later;<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> but all preceding Turgot and
John Adams. Each, however, spoke from his own soul,
and without prompting.</p>

<h4>TURGOT, 1750, 1770, 1776, 1778.</h4>

<p>Among the illustrious names of France few equal that
of Turgot. He was a philosopher among ministers, and
a minister among philosophers. Malesherbes said of
him, that he had the heart of L’Hôpital and the head
of Bacon. Such a person in public affairs was an epoch
for his country and for the human race. Had his spirit
prevailed, the bloody drama of the French Revolution
would not have occurred, or it would at least have been
postponed: I think it could not have occurred. He was
a good man, who sought to carry into government the
rules of goodness. His career from beginning to end
was one continuous beneficence. Such a nature was
essentially prophetic, for he discerned the natural laws
by which the future is governed.</p>

<p>He was of an ancient Norman family, whose name
suggests the god Thor. He was born at Paris, 1727, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
died, 1781. Being a younger son, he was destined for
the Church, and began his studies as an ecclesiastic at
the ancient Sorbonne. Before registering an irrevocable
vow, he announced his repugnance to the profession, and
turned aside to other pursuits. Law, literature, science,
humanity, government, now engaged his attention. He
associated himself with the authors of the “Encyclopédie,”
and became one of its contributors. In other
writings he vindicated especially the virtue of Toleration.
Not merely a theorist, he soon arrived at the
high post of Intendant of Limoges, where he developed
talent for administration and sympathy with the people.
The potato came into Limousin through him. But he
continued to employ his pen, particularly on questions
of political economy, which he treated as a master. On
the accession of Louis the Sixteenth he was called to
the Cabinet as Minister of the Marine, and shortly afterwards
gave up this place to be the head of the Finances.
Here he began a system of rigid economy, founded on
curtailment of expenses and enlargement of resources.
The latter was obtained especially by removal of disabilities
from trade, whether at home or abroad, and the
substitution of a single tax on land for a complex multiplicity
of taxes. The enemies of progress were too
strong at that time, and the King dismissed the reformer.
Good men in France became anxious for the
future; Voltaire, in his distant retreat, gave a shriek of
despair, and addressed to Turgot remarkable verses entitled
“Épître à un Homme.” Worse still, the good
edicts of the minister were rescinded, and society was
put back.</p>

<p>The discarded minister gave himself to science, literature,
and friendship. He welcomed Franklin to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
France and to immortality in a Latin verse of marvellous
felicity. He was already the companion of the
liberal spirits who were doing so much for knowledge
and for reform. By writing and by conversation he
exercised a constant influence. His “ideas” seem to
illumine the time. We may be content to follow him
in saying, “The glory of arms cannot compare with the
happiness of living in peace.”<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> He anticipated our definition
of a republic, when he said “it was founded upon
<em>the equality of all the citizens</em>,”<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>&mdash;good words, not yet
practically verified in all our States. Such a government
he, living under a monarchy, bravely pronounced
“the best of all”; but he added, that he “never had
known a constitution truly republican.”<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> With similar
plainness he announced that “the destruction of the
Ottoman Empire would be a real good for all the nations
of Europe,” and he added, still further, for humanity
also, because it would involve the abolition of
negro slavery, and because “to despoil an oppressor is
not to attack, but to vindicate, the common rights of
humanity.”<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> With such thoughts and aspirations the
prophet died.</p>

<p>But I have no purpose of writing a biography, or
even a character. All that I intend is an introduction
to Turgot’s prophetic words. When only twenty-three
years of age, while still an ecclesiastic at the Sorbonne,
the future minister delivered a discourse on the Progress
of the Human Mind, in which, after describing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
the commercial triumphs of the ancient Phœnicians,
covering the coasts of Greece and Asia with their
colonies, he lets drop these remarkable words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Les colonies sont comme des fruits qui ne tiennent à
l’arbre que jusqu’à leur maturité: devenues suffisantes à
elles-mêmes, elles firent ce que fit depuis Carthage,&mdash;<em>ce
que fera un jour l’Amérique</em>.”</p>

<p>“Colonies are like fruits, which hold to the tree only until
their maturity: when sufficient for themselves, they did that
which Carthage afterwards did,&mdash;<em>that which some day America
will do</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On this most suggestive declaration, Dupont de Nemours,
the editor of Turgot’s works in 1808, remarks in
a note:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was in 1750 that M. Turgot, being then only twenty-three
years old, and devoted in a seminary to the study of
theology, divined, foresaw, the revolution which has formed
the United States,&mdash;which has detached them from the
European power apparently the most capable of retaining
its colonies under its dominion.”</p>

</div>

<p>At the time Turgot wrote, Canada was a French possession;
but his words are as applicable to this colony
as to the United States. When will the fruit be ripe?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In contrast with this precise prediction, and yet in
harmony with it, are the words of Montesquieu, in his
ingenious work, which saw the light in 1748, two years
before the discourse of Turgot. In the famous chapter,
“How the laws contribute to form the manners, customs,
and character of a nation,” we have a much-admired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
picture of “a free nation” “inhabiting an
island,” where, without naming England, it is easy to
recognize her greatness and glory. And here we meet
a Delphic passage, also without a name, pointing to the
British Colonies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If this nation sent out colonies, it would do so more to
extend its commerce than its dominion.</p>

<p>“As people like to establish elsewhere what is found established
at home, it would give to the people of its colonies
its own form of government; and this government carrying
with it prosperity, <em>we should see great peoples formed in the
very forests which it should send to inhabit</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The future greatness of the Colonies is insinuated
rather than foretold, and here the prophetic voice is
silent. Nothing is said of the impending separation,
and the beginning of a new nation; so that, plainly,
Montesquieu saw our future less than Turgot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The youthful prophet did not lose his penetrating
vision with years. In the same spirit and with immense
vigor he wrote to the English philosopher, Josiah
Tucker, September 12, 1770:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As a citizen of the world, I see with joy the approach of
an event which, more than all the books of the philosophers,
will dissipate the phantom of commercial jealousy. <em>I speak
of the separation of your colonies from the mother country</em>,
<span class="smcap">which will soon be followed by that of all America
from Europe</span>. It is then that the discovery of this part of
the world will become truly useful to us. It is then that it
will multiply our enjoyments much more abundantly than
when we purchased them with torrents of blood. The English,
the French, the Spaniards, etc., will use sugar, coffee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
indigo, and will sell their products, precisely as the Swiss do
to-day; and they will also, like the Swiss people, have the
advantage, that this sugar, this coffee, this indigo will no
longer serve as a pretext for intriguers to precipitate their
nation into ruinous wars and to oppress them with taxes.”<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is impossible not to feel in this passage the sure
grasp of our American destiny. How clearly and courageously
he announces the inevitable future! But the
French philosopher-statesman again took the tripod.</p>

<p>This was in the discharge of his duties as minister of
the Crown, and in reply to a special application. His
noble opinion is dated 6th April, 1776. Its character
appears in a few sentences:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The present war will probably end in the absolute independence
of the Colonies, and that event will certainly be <em>the
epoch of the greatest revolution in the commerce and politics, not
of England only, but of all Europe</em>.… When the English
themselves shall recognize the independence of their colonies,
<em>every mother country will be forced</em> in like manner to exchange
its dominion over its colonies for bonds of friendship and fraternity.…
When <em>the total separation of America</em> shall have
cured the European nations of commercial jealousy, there
will exist among men one great cause of war the less; and it
is very difficult not to desire an event which is to accomplish
this good for the human race.”<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

</div>

<p>His letter to the English Dr. Price, on the American
Constitutions, abounds in profound observations and in
prophecy. It was written just at the time when France
openly joined against England in our War of Independence,
and is dated March 22, 1778, but did not see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
light until 1784, some years after the death of the author,
when it was published by Dr. Price.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Its criticism
of the American Constitutions aroused John Adams to
his elaborate work in their “Defence.”<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>Of our Union before the adoption of the National
Constitution he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the general union of the provinces among themselves
I do not see a coalition, a fusion of all the parts, making but
one body, one and homogeneous. It is only an aggregation
of parts always too much separated, and preserving always a
tendency to division, by the diversity of their laws, their
manners, their opinions,&mdash;by the inequality of their actual
forces,&mdash;still more by the inequality of their ulterior progress.
It is only a copy of the Dutch Republic: but this
Republic had not to fear, as the American Republic has, the
possible enlargement of some of its provinces. This whole
edifice has been supported hitherto on the false basis of the
very ancient and very vulgar policy: on the prejudice that
nations and provinces, as bodies, can have interests other
than that which individuals have to be free and to defend
their property against brigands and conquerors; a pretended
interest to carry on more commerce than others,&mdash;not to buy
the merchandise of the foreigner, but to force the foreigner
to consume their productions and their manufactures; a pretended
interest to have a vaster territory, to acquire such or
such a province, such or such an island, such or such a village;
an interest to inspire fear in other nations; an interest
to surpass them in the glory of arms, and in that of arts and
sciences.”<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Among the evils to be overcome are, in the Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Colonies, too great an inequality of fortunes, and especially
the large number of black slaves, whose slavery
is incompatible with a good political constitution, and
who, even when restored to liberty, will cause embarrassment
by forming two nations in the same State. In
all the Colonies he deprecates prejudice, attachment to
established forms, a habit of certain taxes, fear of those
which it might be necessary to substitute, the vanity of
the Colonies who deem themselves most powerful, and
the wretched beginning of national pride. Happily he
adds: “I think the Americans destined to aggrandizement,
not by war, but by husbandry.”<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> And he then
proceeds to his aspirations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is impossible not to desire earnestly that this people
may attain to all the prosperity of which they are capable.
They are the hope of the human race. They can become its
model. They are to prove to the world, by the fact, that
men can be free and tranquil, and can dispense with the
chains of all kinds which the tyrants and charlatans of every
cloth have pretended to impose under the pretext of the public
good. They are to give the example of political liberty,
of religious liberty, of commercial and industrial liberty.
The asylum which they open to all the oppressed of all nations
is to console the earth. The facility thereby afforded
for escape from a bad government will force the European
governments to be just and enlightened. The rest of the
world, little by little, will open their eyes to the nothingness
of the illusions in which politicians have indulged. To this
end it is necessary that America should guard against them,
and should not again become, as your ministerial writers
have so often repeated, an image of our Europe, <em>a mass of
divided powers</em>, disputing about territory or commercial profits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
and continually cementing the slavery of the peoples with
their own blood.”<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

</div>

<p>After these admirable thoughts, so full of wisdom and
prophecy, Turgot alludes to the impending war between
France and England:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Our two nations are going to do each other reciprocally
much evil, probably without either of them obtaining any
real advantage. The increase of debts and charges and the
ruin of a great many citizens will be, perhaps, the only result.
England seems to me even nearer to this than France. If
instead of this war you had been able to yield with good
grace from the first moment,&mdash;if it had been given to policy
to do in advance what infallibly it will be forced to do later,&mdash;if
national opinion could have permitted your Government
to anticipate events,&mdash;and, supposing that it had foreseen
them, it had been able to consent at once to the independence
of America without making war on anybody,&mdash;I firmly
believe that your nation would have lost nothing by this
change. It will lose now what it has already expended, and
what it shall yet expend. It will experience for some time a
great falling off in its commerce, great domestic disturbances,
if it is forced to bankruptcy, and, whatever may happen, a
great diminution of political influence abroad. But this last
matter is of very small importance to the real welfare of a
people; and I am not at all of the opinion of the Abbé
Raynal in your motto.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> I do not believe that this will make
you a contemptible nation, and throw you into slavery. On
the contrary, your troubles will perhaps have the effect of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
necessary amputation; they are perhaps the only means of
saving you from the gangrene of luxury and corruption. If
in your agitations you could correct your Constitution by
rendering the elections annual, by apportioning the right of
representation in a manner more equal and more proportioned
to the interests of those represented, you would gain from
this revolution as much, perhaps, as America; for your liberty
would remain to you, and with this and by this your
other losses would be very speedily repaired.”<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Reading such words, the heart throbs and the pulse
beats. Government inspired by such a spirit would become
divine, nations would live at peace together, and
people everywhere be happy.</p>

<h4>HORACE WALPOLE, 1754, 1774, 1777, 1779.</h4>

<p>Most unlike Turgot in character, but with something
of the same spirit of prophecy, and associated in time,
was Horace Walpole, youngest son of England’s remarkable
Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole. With the
former, life was serious always, and human improvement
the perpetual passion; with the latter, there was
a constant desire for amusement, and the world was
little more than a curious gimcrack.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole was born 5th October, 1717, and
died 2d March, 1797, being at his death Earl of Orford.
According to his birth he was a man of fashion;
for a time a member of Parliament; a man of letters
always. To his various talents he added an aggregation
of miscellaneous tastes, of which his house at
Strawberry Hill was an illustration,&mdash;being an elegant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
“Old Curiosity Shop,” with pictures, books, manuscripts,
prints, armor, china, historic relics, and art in all its
forms, which he had collected at no small outlay of time
and money. Though aristocratic in life, he boasted that
his principles were not monarchical. On the two sides
of his bed were hung engravings of Magna Charta and
the Sentence of Charles the First, the latter with the
inscription “<em>Major</em> Charta.” Sleeping between two such
memorials, he might be suspected of sympathy with
America, although the aristocrat was never absent. His
Memoirs, Journals, Anecdotes of Painting in England,
and other works, are less famous than his multifarious
correspondence, which is the best in English literature,
and, according to French judgment, nearer than any
other in our language to that of Madame de Sévigné,
whom he never wearied in praising. It is free, easy,
gossipy, historic, and spicy.</p>

<p>But I deal with him now only as a prophet. And
I begin with his “Memoires of the last Ten Years of
the Reign of George the Second,” where we find the
record that the Colonists were seeking independence.
This occurs in his description of the Duke of Newcastle
as Secretary of State for the Colonies, during
the long Walpole administration. Illustrating what he
calls the Duke’s “mercurial inattention,” he says: “It
would not be credited what reams of papers, representations,
memorials, petitions from that quarter of the
world [the Colonies], lay mouldering and unopened in
his office”; and then, showing the Duke’s ignorance, he
narrates how, when it was hinted that there should be
some defence for Annapolis, he replied, with evasive,
lisping hurry: “Annapolis, Annapolis! Oh, yes, Annapolis
must be defended,&mdash;to be sure, Annapolis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
should be defended;&mdash;where is Annapolis?” But this
negligence did not prevent him from exalting the prerogative
of the Crown; and here the author says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The instructions to Sir Danvers Osborn, a new governor
of New York, seemed better calculated for the latitude of
Mexico and for a Spanish tribunal than for a free, rich British
settlement, and in such opulence and of such haughtiness
that <em>suspicions had long been conceived of their meditating to
throw off their dependence on their mother country</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This stands in the “Memoires” under the date of
1754, and the editor in a note observes, “If, as the
author asserts, this was written at the time, it is a very
remarkable passage.” By direction of the author the
book was “to be kept unopened and unsealed” until a
certain person named should attain the age of twenty-five
years. It was published in 1822. Perhaps the
honesty of this entry will be better appreciated, when
it is noted, that, only a few pages later, Washington,
whom the author afterwards admired, is spoken of as
“this brave braggart” who “learned to blush for his
rodomontade.”<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>As the difficulties with the Colonies increased, he
became more sympathetic and prophetic. In a letter
to Sir Horace Mann, 2d February, 1774, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We have no news, public or private; but there is an
ostrich-egg laid in America, where the Bostonians have
canted three hundred chests of tea into the ocean; for they
will not drink tea with our Parliament.… Lord Chatham
talked of conquering America in Germany. <i>I believe England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
will be conquered some day or other in New England or
Bengal.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In May, 1774, his sympathies again appear:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Nothing was more shocking than the King’s laughing and
saying at his levee that <em>he had as lief fight the Bostonians as
the French</em>. It was only to be paralleled by James the Second
sporting on Jeffreys’s ‘campaign in the West.’”<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And under date of 28th May, 1775, we have his
record of the encounter at Lexington, with the reflection:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thus was the civil war begun, and a victory the first
fruits of it on the side of the Americans, whom Lord Sandwich
had had the folly and rashness to proclaim cowards.”<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

</div>

<p>His letters to the Countess of Ossory, written during
the war, show his irrepressible sentiments. Thus, under
date of 9th November, 1775:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I think this country undone almost beyond redemption.
Victory in any war but a civil one fascinates mankind with
a vision of glory. What should we gain by triumph itself?
Would America laid waste, deluged with blood, plundered,
enslaved, replace America flourishing, rich, and free? Do
we want to reign over it, as the Spaniards over Peru, depopulated?
Are desolate regions preferable to commercial
cities?”<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then under date of 6th July, 1777:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My humble opinion is, that we shall never recover
America, and that France will take care that we shall never
recover ourselves.”<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

</div>

<p>“Friday night, late,” 5th December, 1777, he breaks
forth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Send for Lord Chatham! They had better send for
General Washington, Madam,&mdash;or at least for our troops
back.… No, Madam, we do not want ministers that
would protract our difficulties. I look on them but as beginning
now, and am far from thinking that there is any
man or set of men able enough to extricate us. <em>I own
there are very able Englishmen left, but they happen to be
on t’other side of the Atlantic.</em> If his Majesty hopes to find
them here, I doubt he will be mistaken.”<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

</div>

<p>“Thursday night,” 11th December, 1777, his feelings
overflow in no common language:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Was ever proud, insolent nation sunk so low? Burke
and Charles Fox told him [Lord North] the Administration
thought of nothing but keeping their places; and so they
will, and the members their pensions, and the nation its infamy.
Were I Franklin, I would order the Cabinet Council
to come to me at Paris with ropes about their necks, and
then kick them back to St. James’s.</p>

<p>“Well, Madam, as I told Lord Ossory t’other day, I am
satisfied: <em>Old England is safe,&mdash;that is, America, whither
the true English retired under Charles the First</em>: this is
Nova Scotia, and I care not what becomes of it.…
Adieu, Madam! I am at last not sorry you have no son;
and your daughters, I hope, will be married to Americans,
and not in this dirty, despicable island.”<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>All this is elevated by his letter of 17th February,
1779, where he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Liberty has still a continent to exist in. I do not care
a straw who is Minister in this abandoned country. It is
<em>the good old cause of Freedom</em> that I have at heart.”<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus with constancy, where original principle was
doubtless quickened by party animosity, did Horace
Walpole maintain the American cause and predict a
new home for Liberty.</p>

<h4>JOHN ADAMS, 1755, 1765, 1776, 1780, 1785, 1787, 1813, 1818.</h4>

<p>Next in time among the prophets was John Adams,
who has left on record at different dates predictions
showing a second-sight of no common order. Of his
life I need say nothing, except that he was born 19th
October, 1735, and died 4th July, 1826. I mention
the predictions in the order of utterance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. While teaching a school at Worcester, and when
under twenty years of age, he wrote a letter to one of
his youthful companions, bearing date 12th October,
1755, which is a marvel of foresight. Fifty-two years
afterwards, when already much of its prophecy had
been fulfilled, the original was returned to its author
by the son of his early comrade and correspondent,
Nathan Webb, who was at the time dead. After remarking
gravely on the rise and fall of nations, with
illustrations from Carthage and Rome, he proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“England began to increase in power and magnificence,
and is now the greatest nation upon the globe. Soon after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
the Reformation, a few people came over into this New
World for conscience’ sake. Perhaps this apparently trivial
incident <em>may transfer the great seat of empire into America</em>.
<em>It looks likely to me</em>: for, if we can remove the turbulent
Gallics, our people, according to the exactest computations,
will in another century become more numerous than England
itself. Should this be the case, since we have, I may
say, all the naval stores of the nations in our hands, it will
be easy to obtain the mastery of the seas; and then the
united force of all Europe will not be able to subdue us.
The only way to keep us from setting up for ourselves is to
disunite us. <i>Divide et impera.</i> Keep us in distinct colonies,
and then some great men in each colony desiring the
monarchy of the whole, they will destroy each other’s influence,
and keep the country <i>in equilibrio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On this his son, John Quincy Adams, famous for
important service and high office, remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Had the political part of it been written by the minister
of state of a European monarchy, at the close of a long life
spent in the government of nations, it would have been pronounced
worthy of the united penetration and experience of a
Burleigh, a Sully, or an Oxenstiern.… <em>In one bold outline
he has exhibited by anticipation a long succession of prophetic
history, the fulfilment of which is barely yet in progress,
responding exactly hitherto to his foresight</em>, but the full accomplishment
of which is reserved for the development of after
ages. The extinction of the power of France in America, the
union of the British North American Colonies, the achievement
of their independence, and the establishment of their
ascendency in the community of civilized nations by the
means of their naval power, are all foreshadowed in this

<p>2. Another beautiful instance followed ten years
later. In the beginning of 1765, Jeremy Gridley, the
eminent lawyer of Colonial days, formed a law club, or
Sodality, at Boston, for the mutual improvement of its
members. Here John Adams produced the original
sketch of his “Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal
Law,” which appeared in the “Boston Gazette” of
August, 1765, was immediately and repeatedly reprinted
in London, and afterwards in Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
The sketch began:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This Sodality has given rise to the following speculation
of my own, which I commit to writing as hints for future
inquiries rather than as a satisfactory theory.”<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In this Dissertation, the writer dwells especially upon
the settlers of British America, of whom he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After their arrival here, they began their settlement,
and formed their plan, both of ecclesiastical and civil government,
in direct opposition to the canon and the feudal
systems.”<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This excellent statement was followed, in the original
sketch communicated to the Sodality, by this passage,
which does not appear in the printed Dissertation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I always consider the settlement of America with reverence
and wonder, as the opening of a grand scene and
design in Providence for the illumination of the ignorant
and the emancipation of the slavish part of mankind all
over the earth.”<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>On these prophetic words, his son, John Quincy
Adams, remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This sentence was perhaps omitted from an impression
that it might be thought to savor not merely of enthusiasm,
but of extravagance. Who now would deny that this magnificent
anticipation has been already to a great degree realized?
Who does not now see that the accomplishment of
this great object is already placed beyond all possibility of
failure?”<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

</div>

<p>His grandson, Charles Francis Adams, alluding to
the changes which took place in the original sketch,
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As not infrequently happens, however, in this process,
one strong passage was lost by it, which at this time must
be regarded as the most deserving of any to be remembered.”<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus again, at an early day, did this prophet discern
the future. How true it is that the mission of this Republic
is “the illumination of the ignorant,” and, still
further, “the emancipation of the slavish part of mankind
all over the earth”! Universal enlightenment and
universal emancipation! And the first great stage was
National Independence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>3. The Declaration of Independence bears date 4th
July, 1776, for on that day it was signed; but the vote
which determined it was on the 2d July. On the 3d
July, John Adams, in a letter to his wife, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Yesterday the greatest question was decided which ever
was debated in America; and a greater, perhaps, never was
nor will be decided among men.… I am surprised at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
suddenness as well as greatness of this revolution. Britain
has been filled with folly, and America with wisdom. At
least this is my judgment. Time must determine. <em>It is the
will of Heaven that the two countries should be sundered forever.…</em>
The day is passed. The second day of July,
1776, will be the most memorable epocha in the history of
America. <em>I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by
succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival.</em> It
ought to be commemorated, as the day of deliverance, by
solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be
solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports,
guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this
continent to the other, from this time forward, forevermore.
You will think me transported with enthusiasm, but I am
not. I am well aware of the toil and blood and treasure
that it will cost us to maintain this Declaration, and support
and defend these States. <em>Yet, through all the gloom, I
can see the rays of ravishing light and glory. I can see that
the end is more than worth all the means, and that posterity
will triumph in that day’s transaction</em>, even although we
should rue it, which I trust in God we shall not.”<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here is a comprehensive prophecy, first, that the two
countries would be separated forever; secondly, that
the anniversary of Independence would be celebrated
as a great annual festival; and, thirdly, that posterity
would triumph in this transaction, where, through all
the gloom, shone rays of ravishing light and glory: all
of which has been fulfilled to the letter. Recent events
give to the Declaration additional importance. For a
long time its great premises, that all men are equal,
and that rightful government stands only on the consent
of the governed, were disowned by our country.
Now that at last they are beginning to prevail, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
is increased reason to celebrate the day on which the
mighty Declaration was made, and new occasion for
triumph in the rays of ravishing light and glory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>4. Here is another prophetic passage, in a letter
dated at Paris, 13th July, 1780, and addressed to the
Comte de Vergennes of France, pleading the cause of
the Colonists:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The United States of America are a great and powerful
people, whatever European statesmen may think of them.
If we take into our estimate the numbers and the character
of her people, the extent, variety, and fertility of her
soil, her commerce, and her skill and materials for ship-building,
and her seamen, excepting France, Spain, England,
Germany, and Russia, there is not a state in Europe
so powerful. Breaking off such a nation as this from the
English so suddenly, and uniting it so closely with France,
is one of the most extraordinary events that ever happened
among mankind.”<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Perhaps this may be considered statement rather than
prophecy; but it illustrates the prophetic character of
the writer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>5. While at Amsterdam, in 1780, Mr. Adams met a
gentleman whom he calls “the giant of the law,” Mr.
Calkoen. After an unsatisfactory attempt at conversation,
where neither spoke the language of the other, it
was arranged that the latter should propound a series
of questions in writing, which the American minister
undertook to answer. The questions were in Dutch,
the answers in English. Among the questions was
this: “Whether America in and of itself, by means of
purchasing or exchanging the productions of the several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
provinces, would be able to continue the war for
six, eight, or ten years, even if they were entirely deprived
of the trade with Europe, or their allies, exhausted
by the war and forced to make a separate
peace, were to leave them?” To this question our
prophet replied:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This is an extreme case.… Why, then, should we
put cases that we know can never happen? However, I
can inform you that the case was often put before this
war broke out; and I have heard the common farmers in
America reasoning upon these cases seven years ago. I
have heard them say, if Great Britain could build a wall
of brass a thousand feet high all along the sea-coast, at
low-water mark, we can live and be happy. <em>America is
most undoubtedly capable of being the most independent country
upon earth.</em> It produces everything for the necessity,
comfort, and conveniency of life, and many of the luxuries
too. So that, if there were an eternal separation between
Europe and America, the inhabitants of America would not
only live, but multiply, and, for what I know, be wiser,
better, and happier than they will be as it is.”<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here is an assertion of conditions essential to independence
of “the most independent country upon
earth,” with a promise that the inhabitants will multiply.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>6. In an official letter to the President of Congress,
dated at Amsterdam, 5th September, 1780, the same
writer, while proposing an American Academy “for refining,
correcting, improving, and ascertaining the English
language,” predicts the extension of this language:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<em>English is destined to be in the next and succeeding centuries
more generally the language of the world than Latin
was in the last or French is in the present age.</em> The reason
of this is obvious,&mdash;because the increasing population in
America, and their universal connection and correspondence
with all nations, will, aided by the influence of England in
the world, whether great or small, force their language into
general use, in spite of all the obstacles that may be thrown
in their way, if any such there should be.”<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In another letter, of unofficial character, dated at
Amsterdam, 23d September, 1780, he thus repeats his
prophecy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You must know <em>I have undertaken to prophesy that English
will be the most respectable language in the world; and
the most universally read and spoken, in the next century,
if not before the close of this</em>. American population will in
the next age produce a greater number of persons who will
speak English than any other language, and these persons
will have more general acquaintance and conversation with
all other nations than any other people.”<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

</div>

<p>David Hume, in a letter to Gibbon, 24th October,
1767, had already written:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Our solid and increasing establishments in America,
where we need less dread the inundation of Barbarians,
<em>promise a superior stability and duration to the English
language</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But these more moderate words, which did credit to
the discernment of the philosopher-historian, were then
unpublished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>The prophecy of John Adams is already accomplished.
Of all the European languages, English is most extensively
spoken. Through England and the United States
it has become the language of commerce, which sooner
or later must embrace the globe. The German philologist,
Grimm, has followed our American prophet in
saying that it “seems chosen, like its people, to rule
in future times in a still greater degree in all the corners
of the earth.”<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>7. Another field was opened by a European correspondent,
John Luzac, who writes from Leyden, under
date of 14th September, 1780, that, in pleading the
cause of American Independence, he has twenty times
encountered, from sensible and educated people, an objection
which he sets forth as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Yes, but if America becomes free, she will some day give
the law to Europe. She will take our islands, and our
colonies at Guiana; she will seize all the Antilles; she will
absorb Mexico, even Peru, Chili, and Brazil; she will carry
off our freighting commerce; she will pay her benefactors
with ingratitude.”<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

</div>

<p>To this Mr. Adams replied, in a letter from Amsterdam,
15th September, 1780:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have met often in Europe with the same species of
reasoners that you describe; but I find they are not numerous.
Among men of reflection the sentiment is generally
different, and that no power in Europe has anything to fear
from America. The principal interest of America for many
centuries to come will be landed, and her chief occupation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
agriculture. Manufactures and commerce will be but secondary
objects, and always subservient to the other. America
will be the country to produce raw materials for manufactures,
but Europe will be the country of manufactures; and
the commerce of America can never increase but in a certain
proportion to the growth of its agriculture, until its whole
territory of land is filled up with inhabitants, which will not
be in some hundreds of years.”</p>

</div>

<p>After referring to tar, iron, and timber as American
articles, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In fact, the Atlantic is so long and difficult a navigation,
that the Americans will never be able to afford to carry to
the European market great quantities of these articles.”</p>

</div>

<p>If the prophet fails here, he is none the less wise in
the suggestion with which he closes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If Europe cannot prevent, or rather if any particular nations
of Europe cannot prevent, the independence of America,
then the sooner her independence is acknowledged, the better,&mdash;the
less likely she will be to become warlike, enterprising,
and ambitious. The truth is, however, that America can
never unite in any war but a defensive one.”<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Had the prophet foreseen the increasing facilities of
commerce, the triumphs of steam, the floating masses
of transportation, the wonders of navigation, quickened
and guided by the telegraph, and to these had he added
the diversified industry of the country, extending, expanding,
and prevailing, his remarkable vision, which
already saw so much, would have viewed other glories
in assured certainty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>8. There is another prophecy, at once definite and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
broad, from the same eminent quarter. In a letter
dated London, 17th October, 1785, and addressed to
John Jay, at the time Secretary for Foreign Affairs
under the Confederation, John Adams reveals his conviction
of the importance of France to us, “while
England held a province in America”;<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> and then, in
another letter, dated 21st October, 1785, reports the
saying of people about him, “<em>that Canada and Nova
Scotia must soon be ours</em>; there must be a war for it,&mdash;they
know how it will end,&mdash;but the sooner, the
better; this done, we shall be forever at peace,&mdash;till
then, never.”<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> These intimations foreshadow the
prophecy found in the Preface to his “Defence of the
American Constitutions,” written in London, while minister
there, and dated Grosvenor Square, 1st January,
1787:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The United States of America have exhibited, perhaps,
the first example of governments erected on the simple
principles of Nature.… Thirteen governments thus
founded on the natural authority of the people alone, without
a pretence of miracle or mystery, and <em>which are destined
to spread over the northern part of that whole quarter of
the globe</em>, are a great point gained in favor of the rights
of mankind. The experiment is made, and has completely
succeeded.”<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here is foretold nothing less than that our system
of government is to embrace the whole continent of
North America.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>9. This series may be concluded by other words,
general in character, but deeply prophetic, showing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
constant sense of the unfolding grandeur and influence
of the Republic.</p>

<p>The first is from the concluding chapter of the work
last cited, and in harmony with the Preface:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A prospect into futurity in America is like contemplating
the heavens through the telescopes of Herschel. Objects
stupendous in their magnitudes and motions strike us from
all quarters, and fill us with amazement.”<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus, also, he writes to Thomas Jefferson, November
15, 1813:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Many hundred years must roll away before we shall
be corrupted. <em>Our pure, virtuous, public-spirited, federative
Republic will last forever, govern the globe, and introduce the
perfection of man.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then, again, in a letter to Hezekiah Niles, 13th February,
1818:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The American Revolution was not a common event.
Its effects and consequences have already been awful over
a great part of the globe. <em>And when and where are they
to cease?</em>”<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The prophetic spirit which filled the “visions” of
youth continued in the “dreams” of age. Especially
was he constant in foreseeing the widening reach of
the great Revolution he had helped at its beginning;
and this arrested the attention of his eloquent eulogist
at Faneuil Hall.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<h4>MARQUIS DE MONTCALM, 1758, 1759.</h4>

<p>If I enter the name of the Marquis de Montcalm
on this list, it is because prophetic words have been
attributed to him which at different periods have attracted
no small attention. He was born near Nismes,
in France, 1712, and died at Quebec, 14th September,
1759, being at the time commander of the French
forces in Canada. As a soldier he was the peer of his
opponent, Wolfe, who perished in the same battle, and
they have since enjoyed a common fame.</p>

<p>In 1777, amidst the heats of our Revolutionary contest,
a publication was put forth by Almon, the pamphleteer,
in French and English on opposite pages,
entitled “Letters from the Marquis de Montcalm, Governor-General
of Canada, to Messrs. De Berryer and
De la Molé, in the Years 1757, 1758, and 1759,” and
the soldier reappeared as prophet.</p>

<p>The first letter is addressed to M. de Berryer, First
Commissioner of the Marine of France, and purports to
be dated at Montreal, 4th April, 1757. It contains the
copy of an elaborate communication from “S. J.” of Boston,
proposing a scheme for undermining the power of
Great Britain in the Colonies by free trade with France
through Canada, and predicting that “all our colonies in
less than ten years will catch fire.”<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> In transmitting
this letter Montcalm did little more than indorse its
sentiments; but in his second letter to the same person,
dated at Montreal, 1st October, 1758, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All these informations, which I every day receive, confirm
me in my opinion that <em>England will one day lose her
colonies on the continent of America</em>; and if Canada should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
then be in the hands of an able governor who understands
his business, he will have a thousand opportunities of hastening
the event: this is the only advantage we can reap for all
it has cost us.”<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the third letter, addressed to M. Molé, First President
of the Parliament of Paris, and dated at the camp
before Quebec, 24th August, 1759, on the eve of the
fatal battle in which both commanders fell, Montcalm
mounts the tripod:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They are in a condition to give us battle, which I must
not refuse, and which I cannot hope to gain.… The event
must decide. But of one thing be certain, that I probably
shall not survive the loss of the Colony.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> … I shall at
least console myself on my defeat, and on the loss of the
Colony, by the full persuasion that this defeat will one day
serve my country more than a victory, and that the conqueror,
in aggrandizing himself, will find his tomb the country
he gains from us.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>… All the English Colonies would
long since have shaken off the yoke, each province would
have formed itself into a little independent republic, if the
fear of seeing the French at their door had not been a check
upon them.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>… Canada, once taken by the English, would
in a few years suffer much from being forced to be English.…
They would soon be of no use to England, and perhaps
they would oppose her.”<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At once, on their appearance, these letters played
an important part in the “high life” of politics. The
“Monthly Review”<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> called them “genuine.” The “Gentleman’s
Magazine”<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> said that “the sagacity of this
accomplished general was equal to his bravery,” and
quoted what it characterized as a “remarkable prediction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>”
In the House of Lords, 30th May, 1777, during
a debate begun by Lord Chatham, and flashing with
great names, Lord Shelburne said that they “had been
discovered to be a forgery”;<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> but Lord Mansfield, the
illustrious Chief Justice, relied upon the letters, “which
he insisted were not spurious.”<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> In another important
debate in the House of Lords, 5th March, 1778, Earl
Temple observed that “the authenticity of those letters
had been often disputed; but he could affirm that he
saw them in manuscript, among the papers of a minister
now deceased, long before they made their appearance
in print, and at a time when American independency
was in the contemplation of a very few persons
indeed.”<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Such was the contemporary testimony; but
the pamphlet shared the fate of the numerous brood
engendered by the war.</p>

<p>Oblivion seemed to have settled on these letters,
when their republication at Gibraltar, as late as 1858,
by an author who treated them as genuine,<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> attracted
the attention of Thomas Carlyle, who proceeded to
make them famous again, by introducing them as an
episode in his Life of Frederick, sometimes called “the
Great.” Montcalm appears once more as prophet, and
the readers of the career of the Prussian monarch turn
with wonder to the inspired Frenchman, with “his
power of faithful observation, his sagacity and talent
of prophecy, so considerable.”<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Then, quoting a portion
of the last letter, the great author exclaims at
different points: “Prediction first”; “This is a curiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
exact prediction”; “Prediction second, which is
still more curious.”<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>If the letter quoted by Carlyle were genuine, as he
accepted it, (also as it was evidently accepted by Lord
John Russell,)<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> and as the family of Montcalm seem to
believe, it would indicate for the soldier all that was
claimed by his descendant, when, after speaking of his
“political foresight,” he added that it “was proved by
one of his letters, in which he made a remarkable
prophecy concerning the American Revolution.”<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> Certainly,&mdash;if
the letter is not an invention; but such is
the present impression. On the half-title of the original
pamphlet, in the Library of Harvard University,
Sparks, whose judgment is of great weight, has written:
“The letters are unquestionably spurious.” Others unite
with him. It is impossible to read the papers in the
“Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society,”
already quoted, and the pungent note of Henry Stevens,
in his “Bibliotheca Historica,” under the title of the
much-debated pamphlet, without feeling, that, whatever
may have been the merits of Montcalm as a soldier,
his title as a prophet cannot be accepted. His name is
introduced here that I may not omit an instance which
has attracted attention in more than one generation.</p>

<h4>DUC DE CHOISEUL, 1767, 1768.</h4>

<p>Another Frenchman in this far-sighted list was the
Comte de Stainville, afterwards Duc de Choiseul, born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
28th June, 1719, and died 8th May, 1785. His brilliant
career as diplomatist and statesman was preceded
by a career of arms with rapid promotion, so that at the
age of forty he became lieutenant-general. Meanwhile
he was ambassador at Rome and then at Vienna, the
two pinnacles of diplomatic life. In 1758 he became
Minister of Foreign Affairs, also duke and peer; then
Minister of War, and of the Marine; but in 1766 he
resumed the Foreign Office, which he held till 1770,
when he was disgraced. The King could not pardon
the contempt with which, although happy in the smiles
of Madame de Pompadour, the Prime-Minister rejected
the advances of her successor, the ignoble Du Barry;
and he was exiled from court to live in his château
of Chanteloup, in the valley of the Loire, where, dispensing
a magnificent hospitality, he was consoled by
a loving wife and devoted friends.</p>

<p>He had charm of manner rather than person, with
a genius for statesmanship recognized and commemorated
in contemporary writings. Madame du Deffant
speaks of him often in her correspondence, and depicts
him in her circle when Franklin was first presented
there. Horace Walpole returns to him in letters and
in his memoirs, attributing to him “great parts,” calling
him “very daring, dashing, and whose good-nature
would not have checked his ambition from doing any
splendid mischief.”<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> The Abbé Barthélemy, in his
“Travels of Anacharsis,” portrays him under the character
of Arsame. Frederick of Prussia, so often called
the Great, hailed him “Coachman of Europe.” And
our own historian Bancroft, following Chatham, does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
not hesitate to call him “the greatest minister of France
since Richelieu.”</p>

<p>The two volumes of Memoirs purporting to be written
by himself, and printed under his eyes in his cabinet
in 1778, were accidental pieces, written, but never
collected by him, nor intended as memoirs.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> In the
French treasure-house of these productions they are of
little value, if not unworthy of his fame.</p>

<p>Besides a brilliant and famous administration of affairs,
are several acts not to be forgotten. At Rome
his skill was shown in bringing Benedict the Fourteenth
to a common understanding on the bull <i>Unigenitus</i>.
Through him in 1764 the Jesuits were suppressed
in France, or were permitted only on condition
of fusing with the secular clergy. But nothing in his
career was more memorable than his foresight and
courage with regard to the English Colonies. American
Independence was foreseen and helped by him.</p>

<p>The Memoirs of Choiseul have little of the elevation
recognized in his statesmanship, nor are they anywhere
prophetic. Elsewhere his better genius was manifest,
especially in his diplomacy. This was recognized by
Talleyrand, who, in a paper on the “Advantages to be
derived from New Colonies,” read before the Institute
toward the close of the last century, characterized him
as “one of the men of our age who had the most forecast
of mind,&mdash;<em>who already in 1769 foresaw the separation
of America from England</em>, and feared the partition of
Poland”; and he adds that “from this epoch he sought to
prepare by negotiations the cession of Egypt to France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
that on the day our American colonies should escape
from us, he might be ready to replace them with the
same productions and a more extended commerce.”<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>Bancroft, whose work shows unprecedented access
to original documents, recognizes the prevision of the
French minister at an earlier date, as attested by the
archives of the French Foreign Office. In 1766 he received
the report of a special agent who had visited
America. In 1767 he sent Baron de Kalb, afterwards
an officer in our Revolution,&mdash;sparing no means to
obtain information, and drawing even from New England
sermons, of which curious extracts are preserved
among the State Papers of France.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> In August of this
year, writing to his plenipotentiary at London, the Minister
says with regard to England and her Colonies:
“Let her but attempt to establish taxes in them, and
those countries, greater than England in extent, and
perhaps becoming more populous, having fisheries, forests,
shipping, corn, iron, and the like, will easily and
fearlessly separate themselves from the mother country.”<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
In the next year Du Châtelet, son of her who
was the companion of Voltaire and the French translator
of Newton, becomes his most sympathetic representative.
To him the Minister wrote, 15th July, 1768:
“According to the prognostications of sensible men,
who have had opportunity to study the character of
the Americans, and to measure their progress from day
to day in the spirit of independence, this separation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
of the American Colonies from the metropolis sooner
or later must come.… I see all these difficulties,
and do not dissemble their extent; but I see also the
controlling interest of the Americans to profit by the
opportunity of a rupture to establish their independence.”<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
Again he wrote, 22d November, 1768: “The
Americans will not lose out of their view their rights
and their privileges; and next to fanaticism for religion,
the fanaticism for liberty is the most daring in its
measures and the most dangerous in its consequences.”<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
That the plenipotentiary was not less prompt in forecast
appears in a letter of 9th November, 1768: “Without
exaggerating the projects or the union of the Colonies,
the time of their independence is very near.…
Three years ago the separation of the English Colonies
was looked upon as an object of attention for the next
generation; the germs were observed, but no one could
foresee that they would be so speedily developed. This
new order of things, this event which will necessarily
have the greatest influence on the whole political system
of Europe, will probably be brought about within
a very few years.”<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> The Minister replied, 20th December,
1768: “Your views are as subtle as they are comprehensive
and well-considered. The King is perfectly
aware of their sagacity and solidity, and I will communicate
them to the Court of Madrid.”<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>These passages show a persistency of view, which
became the foundation of French policy; so that the
Duke was not merely a prophet, but a practical statesman,
guided by remarkable foresight. He lived long
enough to witness the National Independence he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
foretold, and to meet Franklin at Paris, while saved
from witnessing the overthrow of the monarchy he
had served, and the bloody harvest of the executioner,
where a beloved sister was among the victims.</p>

<h4>ABBÉ RAYNAL, 1770-1780.</h4>

<p>Guillaume Thomas François Raynal, of France,
was born 11th March, 1711, and died 6th March,
1796, thus spanning, with his long life, from the failing
years of Louis the Fourteenth to the Reign of Terror,
and embracing the prolonged period of intellectual
activity which prepared the Revolution. Among
contemporary “philosophers” his place was considerable.
But he was a philosopher with a cross of the
adventurer and charlatan.</p>

<p>Beginning as Jesuit and as priest, he somewhat tardily
escaped the constraints of the latter to employ
the education of the former in literary enterprise. A
long list of acknowledged works attests the activity of
his pen, while others were attributed to him. With
these avocations, yielding money, mingled jobbing and
speculation, where even the slave-trade, afterwards furiously
condemned, became a minister of fortune. In
the bright and audacious circles of Paris, especially
with Diderot and D’Holbach, he found society. The
remarkable fame which he reached during life has
ceased, and his voluminous writings slumber in oblivion,
except, perhaps, a single one, which for a while
played a great part, and by its prophetic spirit vindicates
a place in our American gallery.</p>

<p>Only the superficial character of this work appears
in its title,&mdash;“Philosophical and Political History of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
the Establishments and of the Commerce of the Europeans
in the two Indies,”<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> being in six volumes. It
was a frame for pictures and declamations, where freedom
of thought was practically illustrated. Therefore
it was published without the name of the author, and
at Amsterdam. This was as early as 1770. Edition
followed edition. The “Biographie Universelle” reports
more than twenty regular and nearly fifty pirated.
At least twelve editions of an English translation saw
the light. It was translated, abridged, and reprinted
in nearly all the languages of Europe. The subject
was interesting at the time, but the peculiar treatment
and the open assault upon existing order gave the work
zest and popularity. Though often vicious in style, it
was above the author in force and character, so that it
was easy to believe that important parts were contributed
by others. Diderot, who passed his life in
helping others, is said to have supplied nearly a third
of the whole. The work at last drew down untimely
vengeance. Inspired by its signal success, the author, in
1780, after the lapse of a decade, put forth an enlarged
edition, with frontispiece and portrait, the whole reinforced
with insertions and additions, where Christianity
and even the existence of a God were treated with the
license already applied to other things. The Parliament
of Paris, by a decree dated May 21, 1781, handed
the work to the public executioner to be burned, and
condemned the author in person and goods. Several
years of exile followed.</p>

<p>The Revolution in France found the Abbé Raynal
mellowed by time, and with his sustaining philosophers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
all dead. Declining active participation in the great
conflict, he reappeared at last, so far as to address the
President of the National Assembly a letter, where he
pleaded for moderation and an active government. The
ancient assailant of kings now called for “the tutelary
protection of the royal authority.” The early <em>cant</em> was
exchanged for <em>recant</em>.</p>

<p>The concluding book of the enlarged edition of his
famous work contains a chapter entitled “Reflections
upon the Good and the Evil which the Discovery of
America has done to Europe.”<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> A question of similar
import, “Has the Discovery of America been hurtful or
useful to the Human Race?” he presented as the subject
for a prize of twelve hundred livres, to be awarded
by the Academy of Lyons. Such a question reveals a
strange confusion, inconsistent with all our prophetic
voices, but to be pardoned at a time when the course
of civilization was so little understood, and Buffon had
announced, as the conclusion of science, that the animal
creation degenerated on the American Continent. In
his admirable answer to the great naturalist, Jefferson
repels with spirit the allegation of the Abbé Raynal
that “America has not yet produced one good poet, one
able mathematician, one man of genius in a single art
or science.”<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> But he does not seem aware that the
author in his edition of 1780 had already beaten a retreat
from his original position.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> This is more noteworthy
as the edition appeared before the criticism.</p>

<p>It was after portraying the actual condition of the
English Colonies in colors which aroused the protest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
of Jefferson that the French philosopher surrendered to
a vision of the future. In reply to doubts, he invokes
time, civilization, education, and breaks forth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Perhaps then it will be seen that America is favorable
to genius, to the creative arts of peace and of society. A
new Olympus, an Arcadia, an Athens, a new Greece, on
the Continent, or in the archipelago which surrounds it,
will give birth, perhaps, to Homers, Theocrituses, and, above
all, Anacreons. Perhaps another Newton will rise in the
new Britain. It is from English America, no doubt, that
the first ray of the sciences will shoot forth, if they are to
appear at last under a sky so long clouded. By a singular
contrast with the ancient world, where the arts passed
from the South toward the North, in the new we shall see
the North enlighten the South. Let the English clear the
land, purify the air, change the climate, meliorate Nature;
<em>a new universe will issue from their hands for the glory and
happiness of humanity</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then, speculating on the dissensions prevailing between
the Colonies and the mother country, he announces
separation, but without advantage to the European
rivals of England:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Break the knot which binds the ancient Britain to the
new; soon the Northern Colonies will have more strength
alone than they possessed in their union with the mother
country. That great continent, set free from all compact with
Europe, will be unhampered in all its movements.…
The colonies of our absolute monarchies, … following
the example of the English colonies, will break the chain
which binds them shamefully to Europe.”<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>The New World opens before the prophet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So everything conspires to the great dismemberment, of
which it is not given to foresee the moment. Everything
tends to that,&mdash;both the progress of good in the new hemisphere,
and the progress of evil in the old.</p>

<p>“Alas! the sudden and rapid decline of our morals and
our strength, the crimes of kings and the woes of peoples,
will render even universal that fatal catastrophe which is
to detach one world from the other. The mine is prepared
beneath the foundations of our rocking empires.… In
proportion as our peoples are growing weak and all succumbing
one to another, population and agriculture are increasing
in America. The arts transported by our care will
quickly spring up there. That country, risen from nothing,
burns to figure in its turn upon the face of the globe
and in the history of the world. O posterity! thou wilt
be more happy, perhaps, than thy sad and contemptible
ancestors!”<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The edition of 1780 exhibits his sympathies with the
Colonies. In considering the policy of the House of
Bourbon, he recognizes the grasp of the pending revolution.
“The United States,” he says, “have shown
openly the project of drawing to their confederation
<em>all North America</em>”; and he mentions especially <em>the
invitation to the people of Canada</em>. While questioning
the conduct of France and Spain, he adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<em>The new hemisphere is to detach itself some day from
the old.</em> This great disruption is prepared in Europe by
the fermentation and the clashing of our opinions,&mdash;by the
overthrow of our rights, which made our courage,&mdash;by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
luxury of the court and the misery of the country,&mdash;by the
everlasting hate between the effeminate men, who possess all,
and the strong, even virtuous men, who have nothing to lose
but life. It is prepared in America by the growth of population,
of agriculture, of industry, and of enlightenment. <em>Everything
tends to this scission.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In a sketch which follows are pictured the resources
of “the thirteen confederate provinces” and their future
development. While confessing that the name of Liberty
is sweet,&mdash;that it is the cause of the entire human
race,&mdash;that revolutions in its name are a lesson to despots,&mdash;that
the spirit of justice, which compensates past
evils by future happiness, is pleased to believe that this
part of the New World cannot fail to become one of the
most flourishing countries of the globe,&mdash;and that some
go so far as to fear <em>that Europe may some day find its
masters in its children</em>, he proceeds to facts which may
mitigate anxiety.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>The prophetic words of Raynal differ from others
already quoted. Instead of letters or papers buried in
secrecy or disclosed to a few only, they were open proclamations
circulated throughout Europe, and their influence
began as early as 1770. A prompt translation
made them known in England. In 1777 they were
quoted by an English writer pleading for us.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Among
influences coöperating with the justice of our cause,
they were of constant activity, until at last France,
Spain, and Holland openly united with us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<h4>JONATHAN SHIPLEY, BISHOP OF ST. ASAPH, 1773.</h4>

<p>Not without heartfelt emotion do I write this name,
never to be mentioned by an American without a sentiment
of gratitude and love. Such goodness and ability,
dedicated so firmly to our cause, make Shipley conspicuous
among his contemporaries. In beauty of character
and in prophetic spirit he resembles Berkeley. And yet
biographical dictionaries make little mention of him, and
in our country he is known chiefly through the friendship
of Franklin. He was born about 1714, and died
9th December, 1788.</p>

<p>His actual preferments in the Church attest a certain
success, arrested at last by his sympathy for us. At
an early day John Adams spoke of him as “the best
bishop that adorns the bench.”<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> And we learn from
Wraxall, that it was through the hostility of the King,
that, during the short-lived Coalition Ministry, Fox was
prevented from making him Archbishop of Canterbury.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
But his public life was better than any prelacy. It is
impossible to read his writings without discovering the
stamp of superiority, where accuracy and clearness go
hand in hand with courage and truth.</p>

<p>The relations of Franklin with the good Bishop are
a beautiful episode in our Revolutionary history. Two
men, one English and the other American, venerable
with years, mingled in friendship warm as that of youth,
but steady to the grave, joining identity of sentiment
on important public questions with personal affection.
While Franklin remained in England, as Colonial representative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
watching the currents, he was a frequent guest
at the Englishman’s country home; and there he entered
upon his incomparable autobiography, leaving behind
such pleasant memories that afterwards the family never
walked in the garden “without seeing Dr. Franklin’s
room and thinking of the work that was begun in it.”<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>
One of the daughters, in a touching letter to him, then
at his own home in Philadelphia, informed him of her
father’s death,<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> and in reply to his “dear young friend,”
he expressed his sense of the loss, “not to his family and
friends only, but to his nation, and to the world,” and
then, after mentioning that he was in his eighty-fourth
year and considerably enfeebled, added, “You will, then,
my dear friend, consider this as probably the last line to
be received from me, and as a taking leave.”<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>This brief story prepares the way for the two productions
illustrating his service to us. The first has the
following title: “A Sermon preached before the Incorporated
Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in
Foreign Parts, at their Anniversary Meeting in the Parish
Church of St. Mary-le-Bow, on Friday, February 19,
1773.” Of this discourse several editions appeared in
London, New York, and Boston.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> Lord Chatham, after
confessing himself “charmed and edified” by it, wrote:
“This noble discourse speaks the preacher not only fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
to bear rule in the Church, but in the State; indeed, it
does honor to the Right Reverend Bench.”<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> Franklin,
coupling it with another of his productions relating
to America, wrote: “Had his counsels in those pieces
been attended to by the Ministers, how much bloodshed
might have been prevented, and how much expense
and disgrace to the nation avoided!”<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p>This discourse was from the text, “Glory to God
in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will toward
men.”<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> After announcing that “perhaps the annals of
history have never afforded a more grateful spectacle
to a benevolent and philosophic mind than the growth
and progress of the British Colonies in North America,”
the preacher becomes prophet, and here his words are
memorable:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Colonies in North America have not only taken root
and acquired strength, but seem hastening with an accelerated
progress to such a powerful state <em>as may introduce a
new and important change in human affairs</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then picturing the Colonies as receiving “by inheritance
all the improvements and discoveries of their
mother country,”&mdash;commencing “their flourishing state
at a time when the human understanding has attained
to the free use of its powers, and has learned to act with
vigor and certainty,” and being in such a situation that
“they may avail themselves not only of the experience
and industry, but even of the errors and mistakes of former
days,” the prophet proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The vast continent itself, over which they are gradually
spreading, may be considered as a treasure yet untouched of
natural productions <em>that shall hereafter afford ample matter
for commerce and contemplation</em>. And if we reflect what a
stock of knowledge may be accumulated by the constant
progress of industry and observation, … <em>it is difficult
even to imagine to what height of improvement their discoveries
may extend</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The prophet opens another vista: “And perhaps they
may make as considerable <em>advances in the arts of civil
government</em> and the conduct of life.” Then, exhibiting
the excellences of the British Constitution with its
“equal representation,” which he calls “the best discovery
of political wisdom,” and inquiring anxiously if
they “must rest here, as in the utmost effort of human
genius,” the preacher becomes again prophetic:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“May they not possibly be more successful than their
mother country has been in preserving that reverence and
authority which is due to the laws,&mdash;to those who make,
and to those who execute them? May not a method be
invented of procuring some tolerable share of the comforts
of life to those inferior useful ranks of men to whose industry
we are indebted for the whole? <em>Time and discipline
may discover some means to correct the extreme inequalities
of condition between the rich and the poor, so dangerous to
the innocence and the happiness of both.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Beautiful words! And in the same spirit the prophet
discerns increasing opportunities of progress:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The diversity of new scenes and situations, which so
many growing states must necessarily pass through, <em>may
introduce changes in the fluctuating opinions and manners of
men which we can form no conception of</em>. And not only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
gracious disposition of Providence, but the visible preparation
of causes, <em>seems to indicate strong tendencies towards a
general improvement</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

</div>

<p>To a spirit so elevated the obligations of duty are the
same for nations as for individuals, and he nobly vindicates
the duty of the Christian preacher “to point out
the laws of justice and equity which must ultimately
regulate the happiness of states as well as of individuals,”
and which he declares “are no other than those
benevolent Christian morals which it is the province
of this Society to teach, transferred from the duties of
private life to the administration of public affairs.”<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>
Then again he declares amazement, in which all but
hardened politicians will unite, at seeing “how slowly
in all countries the principles of natural justice, which
are so evidently necessary in private life, have been admitted
into the administration of public affairs.” And,
in the same spirit, he announces:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A time, I doubt not, will come, in the progressive improvement
of human affairs, when the checks and restraints
we lay on the industry of our fellow-subjects and the jealousies
we conceive at their prosperity will be considered as
the effects of a mistaken policy, prejudicial to all parties,
but chiefly to ourselves.”<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then, after presenting it as “a noble effort of virtuous
ambition … to make our country great and powerful
and rich, not by force or fraud, but by justice,
friendship, and humanity,” this remarkable sermon concludes
with calling attention to “the plain good rules
so often repeated to us in Scripture,” which “lie before
the eyes of men like medicinal herbs in the open
field.”<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of his remarks, the preacher lets drop
words often quoted since, and doubtless considered
much in conversation with Franklin. After setting
forth that the Colonies had “been trusted in a good
measure with the entire management of their affairs,”
he proceeds to say: “And the success they have met
with ought to be to us an ever-memorable proof that
<em>the true art of government consists in not governing too
much</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>In similar spirit the good Bishop came to the defence
of Massachusetts, in the crisis which followed
the nullification of the Tea-Tax,&mdash;as witness an able
pamphlet, printed in 1774, entitled “A Speech intended
to have been spoken on the Bill for altering
the Charters of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay.” In
this most vigorous production, reported by Franklin as
“a masterpiece of eloquence,”<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> where he pleads for reconciliation,
after announcing that England had drawn
from the Colonies, by commerce, “more clear profit than
Spain has drawn from all its mines,”<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> he says: “Let
them continue to enjoy the liberty our fathers gave
them. Gave them, did I say? They are coheirs of
liberty with ourselves; and their portion of the inheritance
has been much better looked after than ours.”<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>
Then again: “My Lords, I look upon North America
as the only great nursery of freemen now left upon
the face of the earth.”<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> And yet once more: “But
whatever may be our future fate, the greatest glory
that attends this country, a greater than any other
nation ever acquired, is to have formed and nursed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
up to such a state of happiness those Colonies whom
we are now so eager to butcher.”<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> Thanks, perpetual
thanks, to the good friend who stood so well by our
country in its beginning, and discerned so clearly its
exalted future!</p>

<h4>DEAN TUCKER, 1774.</h4>

<p>In contrast with Shipley was his contemporary, Josiah
Tucker, also of the Church, who was born 1712,
and died 4th November, 1799.</p>

<p>The contrast is more curious, when it is considered
that Tucker, like Shipley, was for the peaceful separation
of the Colonies from the mother country; but the
former was biting and cynical, while the latter was
sympathetic and kind. The former sent forth a succession
of criticisms as from the tub of Diogenes, while
the latter, with genial power, vindicated America and
predicted its future. The former was a carping censor
and enemy of Franklin; the latter, his loving friend.</p>

<p>Tucker was rector of a church in Bristol and Dean of
Gloucester, and he announces that he had “written near
three hundred sermons, and preached them all again
and again”;<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> but it was by political essays that he
made his name known and became a conspicuous gladiator.</p>

<p>Here it is easy to recognize industry, facility, boldness.
He was not afraid to speak out, nor did he shrink
from coping with those who commanded the public attention,&mdash;joining
issue directly with Burke, “in answer
to his printed speech, <em>said to be spoken</em> in the House of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
Commons on the 22d of March, 1775,”<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> being that famous
masterpiece, on “Conciliation with America,” so
much read, so often quoted, and so highly placed among
the efforts of human genius. The Dean used plain language,
charging the great orator with excelling “in the
art of ambiguous expressions,” and at all times having
one general end in view, “to amuse with tropes and figures
and great swelling words,” and hoping, that, while
emulating the freedom of Burke in examining the writings
and opinions of others, he should do it “with more
decency and good manners.”<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> More than once the Dean
complains that the orator had classed him by name with
what he called “court vermin.”<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>As early as 1766, in the heats of the Stamp Act, he
entered the lists by an unamiable pamphlet, entitled
“A Letter from a Merchant in London to his Nephew
in North America, relative to the Present Posture of
Affairs in the Colonies.” Here appears the vigorous
cynicism of his nature. The mother country is vindicated,
and the Colonies are told that “the complaint of
being unrepresented is entirely false and groundless,”
inasmuch as every member of Parliament, when once
chosen, becomes “the equal guardian of all,” and “<em>our</em>
Birminghams, Manchesters, Leeds, Halifaxes, &amp;c., and
<em>your</em> Bostons, New Yorks, and Philadelphias are all as
<em>really</em>, though not so nominally, represented as any part
whatsoever of the British Empire.”<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> In the same spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
he ridiculed the pretensions of the Colonists, putting
into their mouths the words: “What! an Island! a
spot such as this to command the great and mighty
Continent of North America! Preposterous! A Continent,
whose inhabitants double every five-and-twenty
years! who, therefore, within a century and an half
will be upwards of an hundred and twenty millions
of souls! Forbid it, Patriotism, forbid it, Politics, that
such a great and mighty Empire as this should be held
in subjection by the paltry Kingdom of Great Britain!
<em>Rather let the seat of empire be transferred; and let it be
fixed where it ought to be, namely, in Great America!</em>”<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
And then declaring “the calculations themselves both
false and absurd,” taunting the Colonists with inability
to make the mother country “a province of America,”
and depicting the evils that will ensue to them from
separation, he announces, that, “having been surfeited
with the bitter fruits of American Republicanism, they
will heartily wish and petition to be again united to
the mother country.”<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>As the conflict approached, the Dean became more
earnest and incessant. In 1774 he published a book
entitled “Four Tracts on Political and Commercial
Subjects,” of which the third was a reprint of the
“Letter from a Merchant in London,” and the fourth
was a new appeal, entitled “The True Interest of Great
Britain set forth in regard to the Colonies, and the only
Means of Living in Peace and Harmony with them,”&mdash;“including
Five different Plans for effecting this Desirable
Event.”<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Here he openly proposed separation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
and predicted its advantage to England. On general
grounds he was persuaded that extensive colonies were
an evil rather than an advantage, especially to a commercial
nation, while he was satisfied of a present alienation
on the part of America, which it would be unprofitable,
if not perilous, to combat. England was in
no mood for such truth, and the author was set down
as madman or quack. Evidently he was a prophet.</p>

<p>A few passages will show the character of this remarkable
production.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is the nature of them all [colonies] to aspire after independence,
and to set up for themselves as soon as ever
they find that they are able to subsist without being beholden
to the mother country.”<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

</div>

<p>True enough, and often said by others. In dealing
with the different plans the Dean shows originality.
To the idea of compulsion by arms he exclaimed:
“But, alas! victory alone is but a poor compensation
for all the blood and treasure which must be spilt.”<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
The scheme numbered Fourth was nothing less than “to
consent that America should become the general seat
of empire, and that Great Britain and Ireland should
be governed by viceroys sent over from the court residences
either at Philadelphia or New York, or at some
other American imperial city,”&mdash;to which the indefatigable
Dean replies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now, wild as such a scheme may appear, there are certainly
some Americans who seriously embrace it; and the
late prodigious swarms of emigrants encourage them to suppose
that a time is approaching when the seat of empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
must be changed. But, whatever events may be in the
womb of Time, or whatever revolutions may happen in the
rise and fall of empires, there is not the least probability
that this country should ever become a province to North
America: … unless, indeed, we should add one extravagance
to another, by supposing that these American heroes
are to conquer all the world; and in that case I do allow
that England must become a province to America.”<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then comes the Fifth Scheme, which was, “To propose
to separate entirely from the North American Colonies,
by declaring them to be a free and independent people,
over whom we lay no claim, and then by offering to
guaranty this freedom and independence against all foreign
invaders whatever.”<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> And he proceeds to show
that by such separation the mother country would not
lose the trade of the Colonies. His unamiable nature
flares out in the suggestions, that, “the moment a separation
takes effect, intestine quarrels will begin,” and
that, “in proportion as their factious republican spirit
shall intrigue and cabal, shall split into parties, divide
and subdivide, in the same proportion shall we be called
in to become their general umpires and referees,”<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> while
his confidence in the result is declared: “And yet I
have observed, and have myself had some experience,
that measures evidently right will prevail at last”;
therefore he had “not the least doubt” but that a separation
would take place “within half a century.”<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>
Though seeing the separation so clearly, he did not see
how near at hand it then was.</p>

<p>The Dean grew more earnest. Other pamphlets followed:
for instance, in 1775, “An Humble Address<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
and Earnest Appeal, … whether a Connection with or
a Separation from the Continental Colonies of America
be most for the National Advantage and the Lasting
Benefit of these Kingdoms.” Here he says openly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My scheme, which Mr. Burke, in his last speech, of
March 22, 1775, is pleased to term a <em>childish</em> one, is, To
separate totally from the Colonies, and to reject them from
being fellow-members and joint partakers with us in the
privileges and advantages of the British Empire, because
they refuse to submit to the authority and jurisdiction of
the British legislature,&mdash;offering at the same time to enter
into alliances of friendship and treaties of commerce with
them, as with any other sovereign, independent state.”<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then, insisting that his scheme “most infallibly cuts
off all the present causes of dispute and contention between
the two countries, so that they never can revive
again,”<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> he establishes that commercial intercourse with
the Americans would not cease, inasmuch as it cannot
be shown that they “will no longer adhere to their own
interest when they shall be disunited from us.”<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>Among subsequent tracts was one entitled “<i>Cui Bono?</i>
or, An Inquiry, What Benefits can arise either to
the English or the Americans, the French, Spaniards,
or Dutch, from the Greatest Victories or Successes in
the Present War? Being a Series of Letters addressed
to Monsieur Necker, late Controller-General of the Finances
of France. London, 1782.” Here was the same
ardor for separation, with the same bitter words for the
Colonies.</p>

<p>Tardily the foresight of the Dean was recognized,
until at last Archbishop Whately, in his annotations
upon Bacon’s Essay on Honor and Reputation, commemorates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
it as an historic example. According to
him, “the whole British nation were in one particular
manifestly <em>puzzle-headed</em>, except <em>one</em> man, who was accordingly
derided by all.” Then mentioning the dispute
between the mother country and her colonies, he
says: “But Dean Tucker, standing quite alone, wrote
a pamphlet to show that the separation would be no
loss at all, and that we had best give them the independence
they coveted at once and in a friendly way.
Some thought he was writing in jest; the rest despised
him, as too absurd to be worth answering. But now,
and for above half a century, every one admits that
he was quite right, and regrets that his view was not
adopted.”<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> Unquestionably this is a remarkable tribute.
Kindred to it was that of the excellent Professor
Smyth, who, in exhibiting the “American War,”
dwells on “the superior and the memorable wisdom
of Tucker.”<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>The bad temper shooting from his writings interfered,
doubtless, with their acceptance. His spirit, so
hostile to us, justified his own characterization of himself
as “the author of these tracts against the rebel
Americans.” As the war drew to a close, his bad temper
still prevailed, heightened by antipathy to republicanism,
so that, after picturing the Colonies, separated
at last from the mother country, as having “gained a
general disappointment mixed with anger and indignation,”<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>
he thus predicts their terrible destiny:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As to the future grandeur of America, and its being a
rising empire under one head, whether republican or monarchical,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
it is one of the idlest and most visionary notions
that ever was conceived, even by writers of romance. For
there is nothing in the genius of the people, the situation of
their country, or the nature of their different climates, which
tends to countenance such a supposition.… Above all,
when those immense inland regions beyond the back settlements,
which are still unexplored, are taken into the account,
they form the highest probability that the Americans never
can be united into one compact empire, under any species of
government whatever. Their fate seems to be&mdash;<em>a disunited
people till the end of time</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Alas! But evidently the Dean saw the future of
our continent no better than the Ministry saw their
duty with regard to it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Unlike in spirit was Matthew Robinson, a contemporary
friend of America, whose able and elaborate
tracts<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> in successive editions are now forgotten, except
so far as revived by the notice of Professor Smyth.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
His vindication of the Colonies, at the time of the Boston
Port Bill, was complete, without the harshness of
Tucker, and he did not hesitate to present the impossibility
of conquering them. “What expectation or probability,”
he asks, “can there be of sending from hence
armies capable to conquer and subdue so great a force
of men defending and defended by such a continent?”<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>
Then, while depicting English mastery of the sea, he
says: “We may do whatever a fleet can. Very true;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
but it cannot sail all over North America.”<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> The productions
of this enlightened author cannot have been
without effect. Doubtless they helped the final acknowledgment
of independence. When will the “Old
Mortality” appear, to discover and restore his monument?</p>

<p>The able annotator of Lord Bacon was too sweeping,
when he said that on the great American question all
England was wrong, “except <em>one</em> man.” Robinson was
as right as the Dean, and there were others also. The
“Monthly Review,” in an article on the Dean’s appeal
for separation, said: “This, however, is not a new idea.
It has frequently occurred to others.”<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Even Soame
Jenyns, a life-long member of Parliament, essayist, poet,
defender of Christianity, while upholding the right to
tax the Colonies, is said to have accepted the idea of
“total separation”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Let all who view th’ instructive scene,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And patronize the plan,</div>
<div class="verse">Give thanks to Gloucester’s honest Dean,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>In a better spirit, and with affecting earnestness,
John Cartwright, once of the Royal Navy, and known
as Major from his rank in the Nottinghamshire Militia,
followed the Dean, in 1774, with a series of letters collected
in a pamphlet entitled “American Independence
the Interest and Glory of Great Britain,” where he
insists upon separation, and thenceforward a friendly
league, “that the true and lasting welfare of both countries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
can be promoted.”<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> In enforcing his conclusion
the author says: “When we talk of asserting our sovereignty
over the Americans, do we foresee to what fatal
lengths it will carry us? Are not those nations increasing
with astonishing rapidity? <em>Must they not, in the
nature of things, cover in a few ages that immense continent
like a swarm of bees?</em>”<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Then again: “We may,
indeed, by means of fleets and armies, maintain a precarious
tyranny over the Americans for a while; but the
most shallow politicians must foresee what this would
end in.”<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Then, in reply to the Dean: “’Tis a pity
so able a writer had not discovered that the Americans
have a right to choose their own governors, and
thence enforced the necessity of his proposed separation
as a religious duty, no less than a measure of
national policy.”<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> Cartwright continued at home the
conflicts of principle involved in our War of Independence,
and became an English Reformer. Honor
to his name!</p>

<h4>DAVID HARTLEY, 1775, 1776, 1777, 1785.</h4>

<p>Another English friend was David Hartley. He was
constant and even pertinacious on our side, although
less prophetic than Pownall, with whom he coöperated
in purpose and activity. His father was Hartley the
metaphysician, and author of the ingenious theory of
sensation, who predicted the fate of existing governments
and hierarchies in two simple sentences: “It is
probable that all the present Civil Governments will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
be overturned”; “It is probable that the present forms
of Church Government will be dissolved.”<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> Many were
alarmed. Lady Charlotte Wentworth asked the prophet
when these terrible things would happen. The answer
was: “I am an old man, and shall not live to see
them; but you are a young woman, and probably will
see them.”<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>The son was born in 1729, and died at Bath in 1813.
During our Revolution he sat in Parliament for Kingston-upon-Hull.
He was also the British plenipotentiary
in negotiating the Definitive Treaty of Peace with the
United States. He has dropped out of sight. The biographical
dictionaries afford him a few lines only. But
he deserves a considerable place in the history of our
Independence.</p>

<p>John Adams was often austere, and sometimes cynical,
in his judgments. Evidently he did not like Hartley.
In one place he speaks of him as “a person of
consummate vanity”;<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> then, as “talkative and disputatious,
and not always intelligible”;<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> and in still another
place remarks, “Mr. Hartley was as copious as
usual;”<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> and when appointed to sign the Definitive
Treaty, “It would have been more agreeable to have
finished with Mr. Oswald.”<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> And yet, when writing
most elaborately to the Comte de Vergennes on the
state of affairs previous to the final campaign, he introduces
opinions of Hartley at length, saying that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
was “more for peace than any man in the kingdom.”<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
Such testimony may well outweigh the other expressions,
especially as nothing of the kind appears in the
correspondence of Franklin, with whom Hartley was
much more intimate.</p>

<p>The “Parliamentary History” is a sufficient monument
for Hartley. He was a frequent speaker, and
never missed an opportunity of pleading our cause.
Although without the immortal eloquence of Burke,
he was always clear and full. Many of his speeches
seem written out by himself. He was not a tardy
convert, but began as “a new member” by supporting
an amendment favorable to the Colonies, 5th December,
1774. Then, in March, 1775, he brought forward
“Propositions for Conciliation with America,” which
he sustained in an elaborate speech, where he avowed
that the American question had occupied him for some
time:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Though I have so lately had the honor of a seat in this
House, yet I have for many years turned my thoughts and
attention to matters of public concern and national policy.
This question of America is now of many years’ standing.”<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In this speech he acknowledges the services of New
England at Louisburg:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In that war too, Sir, they took Louisburg from the
French, single-handed, without any European assistance: as
mettled an enterprise as any in our history; an everlasting
memorial of the zeal, courage, and perseverance of the
troops of New England. The men themselves dragged the
cannon over a morass which had always been thought impassable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
where neither horses nor oxen could go; and they
carried the shot upon their backs. And what was their reward
for this forward and spirited enterprise,&mdash;for the reduction
of this American Dunkirk? Their reward, Sir, you know
very well: it was given up for a barrier to the Dutch.”<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

</div>

<p>All his various propositions were negatived; but he
was not disheartened. Constantly he spoke,&mdash;now on
the Budget, then on the Address, and then on specific
propositions. At this time he asserted the power of
Parliament over the Colonies, and he proposed, on the
2d November, 1775, that a test of submission by the
Colonists should be the recognition of an Act of Parliament
enacting “that all the slaves in America should
have the trial by jury.”<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> Shortly afterwards, on the
7th December, 1775, he brought forward a second set
of “Propositions for Conciliation with America,” where,
among other things, he embodied the test on slavery,
which he put forward as a compromise; and here his
language belongs not only to the history of our Revolution,
but to the history of Antislavery. While declaring
that in his opinion Great Britain was “the aggressor in
everything,”<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> he sought to bring the two countries together
on a platform of human rights, which he thus
explained:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The act to be proposed to America, <em>as an auspicious
beginning to lay the first stone of universal liberty to mankind</em>,
should be what no American could hesitate an instant
to comply with, namely, that every slave in North America
should be entitled to his trial by jury in all criminal cases.
America cannot refuse to accept and to enroll such an act
as this, and thereby to reëstablish peace and harmony with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
the parent state. <em>Let us all be reunited in this, as a foundation
to extirpate slavery from the face of the earth. Let those
who seek justice and liberty for themselves give that justice and
liberty to their fellow-creatures.</em> With respect to the idea of
putting a final period to slavery in North America, it should
seem best that when this country had led the way by the act
for jury, that each Colony, knowing their own peculiar circumstances,
should undertake the work in the most practicable
way, and that they should endeavor to establish some
system by which slavery should be in a certain term of years
abolished. <em>Let the only contention henceforward between Great
Britain and America be, which shall exceed the other in zeal
for establishing the fundamental rights of liberty to all mankind.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

</div>

<p>How grand and beautiful!&mdash;not to be read without
gratitude! The motion was rejected; but among the
twenty-three in its favor were Fox and Burke.</p>

<p>During this same month the unwearied defender of
our country came forward again, declaring that he could
not be “an adviser or a well-wisher to any of the vindictive
operations against America, because he thought
the cause unjust; but at the same time he must be
equally earnest to secure British interests from destruction”;
and he thus prophesies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The fate of America is cast. You may bruise its heel,
but you cannot crush its head. It will revive again. <em>The
New World is before them. Liberty is theirs.</em> They have
possession of a free government, their birthright and inheritance,
derived to them from their parent state, which the hand
of violence cannot wrest from them. If you will cast them
off, my last wish is to them, May they go and prosper!”<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, on the 10th May, 1776, he vindicated anew
his original proposition; and here again he testifies for
peace and against slavery:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For the sake of peace, therefore, I did propose a test of
compromise, by an acceptance, on the part of the Colonists,
of an Act of Parliament which should lay <em>the foundation for
the extirpation of the horrid custom of slavery in the New
World</em>.… My motion was … simply as an act of compromise
and reconciliation; and, as far as it was a legislative
act, it was still to have been applied in correcting the
laws of slavery in America, which I considered as repugnant
to the laws of the realm of England, and to the fundamentals
of our Constitution. Such a compromise would at the same
time have saved the national honor.”<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

</div>

<p>All gratitude to the hero who at this early day vowed
himself to the abolition of slavery! Hartley is among
the first of Abolitionists, with hardly a predecessor except
Granville Sharp, and in Parliament absolutely the
first. Clarkson was at this time fifteen years old, Wilberforce
sixteen. Only in 1785 Clarkson obtained the
prize for the best Latin essay on the question, “Is it
right to make men slaves against their will?”<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> It was
not until 1791 that Wilberforce moved for leave to
bring in a bill for the abolition of the slave-trade. It
is no small honor for one man to have come forward
in Parliament as an avowed abolitionist, while at the
same time a vindicator of our independence.</p>

<p>Again, on the 15th May, 1777, Hartley pleaded for
us:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At sea, which has hitherto been our prerogative element,
they rise against us at a stupendous rate; and if we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
return to our old mutual hospitalities towards each other, a
very few years will show us a most formidable hostile marine,
ready to join hands with any of our enemies.… I will
venture to prophesy that the principles of a federal alliance
are the only terms of peace that ever will and that ever ought
to obtain between the two countries.”<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On the 5th of June, three weeks afterwards, the “Parliamentary
History” reports briefly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Hartley went upon the cruelties of slavery, and
urged the Board of Trade to take some means of mitigating
it. He produced a pair of handcuffs, which he said
was a manufacture they were now going to establish.”<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus again the abolitionist reappeared in the vindicator
of our independence. On the 22d June, 1779, he
brought forward another formal motion “for reconciliation
with America,” and, in the course of a well-considered
speech, denounced the ministers for “headstrong
and inflexible obstinacy in prosecuting a cruel and
destructive American war.”<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> On the 3d December,
1779, in what is called “a very long speech,” he returned
to his theme, inveighing against ministers for
“the favorite, though wild, Quixote, and impracticable
measure of coercing America.”<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> These are only instances.</p>

<p>During this time he maintained relations with Franklin,
as appears in the “Diplomatic Correspondence of
the Revolution,” all of which attests a desire for peace.
In 1778 he arrived at Paris on a confidential errand,
especially to confer with Franklin. On this occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
John Adams met him and judged him severely. In
1783 he was appointed a commissioner to sign the Definitive
Treaty of Peace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These things belong to history. Though perhaps not
generally known, they are accessible. I have presented
them for their intrinsic value and prophetic character,
but also as the introduction to an unpublished letter
from Hartley, which I received some time ago from an
English friend, who has since been called away from
important labors. The letter concerns <em>emigration to our
country, and the payment of the national debt</em>. The following
indorsement explains its character:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Note.</span> This is a copy of the material portion of a long
letter from D. Hartley, the British Commissioner in Paris,
to Lord Sydenham, January, 1785. The original was sold
by C. Robinson, of 21 Bond Street, London, on the 6th
April, 1859, at a sale of Hartley’s MSS. and papers, chiefly
relating to the United States of America. It was Hartley’s
copy, in his own hand.</p>

<p>“The lot was No. 82 in the sale catalogue. It was bought
by J. R. Smith, the London bookseller, for £2 6<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i></p>

<p>“I had a copy made before the sale.</p>

<p class="sig">“<span class="smcap">Joseph Parkes.</span></p>

<p class="noindent medium">“<span class="smcap">London</span>, 18 July, ’59.”</p>

</div>

<p>The letter is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;In your Lordship’s last letter to me, just
before my leaving Paris, you are pleased to say that any
information which I might have been able to collect of a
nature to promote the mutual and reciprocal interests of
Great Britain and the United States of America would be
extremely acceptable to his Majesty’s government.…
Annexed to this letter I have the honor of transmitting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
your Lordship some papers and documents which I have
received from the American ministers. One of them (No.
5) is a Map of the Continent of North America, in which
the land ceded to them by the late treaty of peace is divided
by parallels of latitude and longitude into fourteen
new States.</p>

<p>“The whole project, in its full extent, would take many
years in its execution, and therefore it must be far beyond
the present race of men to say, ‘This shall be so.’ Nevertheless,
<em>those who have the first care of this New World will
probably give it such directions and inherent influences as may
guide and control its course and revolutions for ages to come</em>.
But these plans, being beyond the reach of man to predestinate,
are likewise beyond the reach of comment or speculation
to say what may or may not be possible, or to predict
what events may hereafter be produced by time, climates,
soils, adjoining nations, or by the unwieldy magnitude of
empire, <em>and the future population of millions superadded to
millions</em>. The sources of the Mississippi may be unknown;
the lines of longitude and latitude may be extended into
unexplored regions; and the plan of this new creation may
be sketched out by a presumptuous compass, if all its intermediate
uses and functions were to be suspended until the
final and precise accomplishment, without failure or deviation,
of this unbounded plan. But this is not the case; the
immediate objects in view are limited and precise; they are
of prudent thought, and within the scope of human power
to measure out and to execute. The principle, indeed, is
indefinite, and will be left to the test of future ages to determine
its duration or extent.</p>

<p>“I take the liberty to suggest thus much, lest we should
be led away to suppose that the councils which have produced
these plans have had no wiser or more sedate views
than merely the amusement of drawing meridians of ambition
and high thoughts. There appear to me to be two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
solid and rational objects in view: the first is, by the sale
of lands nearly contiguous to the present States, (receiving
Congress paper in payment according to its scale of depreciation,)
<em>to extinguish the present national debt</em>, which I understand
might be discharged for about twelve millions sterling.…</p>

<p>“It is a new proposition to be offered to the numerous
common rank of mankind in all the countries of the world,
to say that there are in America fertile soils and temperate
climates in which an acre of land may be purchased for a
trifling consideration, which may be possessed in freedom,
together with all the natural and civil rights of mankind.
The Congress have already proclaimed this, and that no
other qualification or name is necessary but to become
settlers, without distinction of countries or persons. The
European peasant, who toils for his scanty sustenance in
penury, wretchedness, and servitude, will eagerly fly to this
asylum for free and industrious labor. The tide of emigration
may set strongly outward from Scotland, Ireland,
and Canada to this new land of promise.</p>

<p>“A very great proportion of men in all the countries of
the world are without property, and generally are subject
to governments of which they have no participation, and
over whom they have no control. The Congress have now
opened to all the world a sale of landed settlements where
the liberty and property of each individual is to be consigned
to his own custody and defence.… These are such
propositions of free establishments as have never yet been
offered to mankind, and cannot fail of producing great effects
in the future progress of things. The Congress have
arranged their offers in the most inviting and artful terms;
and lest individual peasants and laborers should not have
the means of removing themselves, they throw out inducements
to moneyed adventurers to purchase and to undertake
the settlement by commission and agency, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
personal residence, by stipulating that the lands of proprietors
being absentees shall not be higher taxed than the
lands of residents. This will quicken the sale of lands,
which is their object.</p>

<p>“For the explanation of these points, I beg leave to refer
your Lordship to the documents annexed, Nos. 5 and 6,&mdash;namely,
the Map, and Resolutions of Congress, dated April,
1784. Another circumstance would confirm that it is the
intention of Congress to invite moneyed adventurers to make
purchases and settlements, which is the precise and mathematical
mode of dividing and marking out for sale the lands
in each new proposed State. These new States are to be
divided by parallel lines running north and south, and by
other parallels running east and west. They are to be divided
into hundreds of ten geographical miles square, and
then again into lots of one square mile. The divisions are
laid out as regularly as the squares upon a chessboard, and
all to be formed into a Charter of Compact.</p>

<p>“They may be purchased by purchasers at any distance,
and the titles may be verified by registers of such or such
numbers, north or south, east or west: all this is explained
by the document annexed, No. 7, namely, <em>The Ordinance for
ascertaining the mode of locating and disposing of lands in
the Western Territory. This is their plan and means for paying
off their national debt, and they seem very intent upon
doing it.</em> I should observe that their debt consists of two
parts, namely, domestic and foreign. The sale of lands is
to be appropriated to the former.</p>

<p>“The domestic debt may perhaps be nine or ten millions,
and the foreign debt two or three. For payment of the foreign
debt it is proposed to lay a tax of five per cent. upon all
imports until discharged, which, I am informed, has already
been agreed to by most of the States, and probably will soon
be confirmed by the rest. Upon the whole, it appears that
this plan is as prudently conceived and as judiciously arranged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
as to the end proposed, as any experienced cabinet
of European ministers could have devised or planned any
similar project.</p>

<p>“The second point which appears to me to be deserving
of attention, respecting the immense cession of territory to
the United States at the late peace, is a point <em>which will
perhaps in a few years become an unparalleled phenomenon
in the political world</em>. As soon as the national debt of the
United States shall be discharged by the sale of one portion
of those lands, we shall then see the Confederate Republic
in a new character, as a proprietor of lands either for sale
or to let upon rents. While other nations may be struggling
under debts too enormous to be discharged either by economy
or taxation, and while they may be laboring to raise
ordinary and necessary supplies by burdensome impositions
upon their own persons and properties, <em>here will be a nation
possessed of a new and unheard-of financial organ of
stupendous magnitude, and in process of time of unmeasured
value, thrown into their lap as a fortuitous superfluity, and
almost without being sought for</em>.</p>

<p>“When such an organ of revenue begins to arise into
produce and exertion, what public uses it may be applicable
to, or to what abuses and perversions it might be rendered
subservient, is far beyond the reach of probable discussion
now. Such discussions would only be visionary speculations.
However, thus far it is obvious, and highly deserving
of our attention, that it cannot fail becoming to the American
States a most important instrument of national power,
the progress and operation of which must hereafter be <em>a most
interesting object of attention to the British American dominions
which are in close vicinity to the territories of the United
States; and I should hope that these considerations would lead
us, inasmuch as we value those parts of our dominions, to encourage
conciliatory and amicable correspondence between them
and their neighbors</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>

<p>This private communication, now for the first time
seeing the light, is full of prophecy, or of that remarkable
discernment and forecast which mark the prophetic
spirit, whether in announcing “the future population
of millions superadded to millions,” or in the
high estimate of the National Territory, destined to
become in a few years “an unparalleled phenomenon
in the political world,” “a new and unheard-of <em>financial
organ</em> of stupendous magnitude.” How few at
home saw the Public Lands with as clear a vision as
Hartley!</p>

<h4>GALIANI, 1776, 1778.</h4>

<p>Among the most brilliant in this extending list is
the Abbé Galiani, the Neapolitan, who was born 1728,
and died at Naples 1787. Although Italian by birth,
yet by the accident of official residence he became
for a while domesticated in France, wrote the French
language, and now enjoys a French reputation. His
writings in French and his letters have the wit and
ease of Voltaire.</p>

<p>Galiani was a genius. Whatever he touched shone
at once with his brightness, in which there was originality
as well as knowledge. He was a finished scholar,
and very successful in lapidary verses. Early in life,
while in Italy, he wrote a grave essay on Money, which
contrasted with another of rare humor suggested by the
death of the public executioner. Other essays followed;
and then came the favor of the congenial pontiff, Benedict
the Fourteenth. In 1760 he found himself at Paris
as Secretary of the Neapolitan Embassy. Mingling with
courtiers officially, according to the duties of his position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
he fraternized with the liberal and adventurous
spirits who exercised such influence over society and
literature. He was recognized as one of them, and inferior
to none. His petty stature was forgotten when
he conversed with inexhaustible faculties of all kinds,
so that he seemed an Encyclopædia, Harlequin, and
Machiavelli all in one. The atheists at the Thursday
dinner of D’Holbach were confounded while he enforced
the existence of God. Into the questions of political
economy occupying attention at the time he entered
with a pen which seemed borrowed from the French
Academy. His “Dialogues sur le Commerce des Blés”
had the success of a romance: ladies carried this book
on Corn in their work-baskets. Returning to Naples,
he continued to live in Paris through his correspondence,
especially with Madame d’Épinay, the Baron
d’Holbach, Diderot, and Grimm.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

<p>Among later works, after his return to Naples, was
a solid volume&mdash;not to be forgotten in the History of
International Law&mdash;on the Duties of Neutrals, where
a difficult subject is treated with such mastery, that,
more than half a century later, D’Hautefeuille, in his
elaborate treatise, copies from it at length. Galiani
was the predecessor of this French writer in the extreme
assertion of neutral rights. Other works were
left at his death in manuscript, some grave and some
humorous; also letters without number. The letters
preserved from Italian <i>savans</i> filled eight large volumes;
those from <i>savans</i>, ministers, and sovereigns
abroad filled fourteen. His Parisian correspondence
did not see the light till 1818, although some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
letters may be found in the contemporary correspondence
of Grimm.</p>

<p>In his Parisian letters, which are addressed chiefly
to that clever individuality, Madame d’Épinay, the
Neapolitan abbé shows not only the brilliancy and
nimbleness of his talent, but the universality of his
knowledge and the boldness of his speculations. Here
are a few words from a letter dated at Naples, 12th
October, 1776, in which he brings forward the idea of
“races,” so important in our day, with an illustration
from Russia:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<em>All depends upon races.</em> The first, the most noble of
races, comes naturally from the North of Asia. The Russians
are the nearest to it, and this is the reason why they
have made more progress in fifty years than can be got out
of the Portuguese in five hundred.”<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Belonging to the Latin race, Galiani was entitled to
speak thus freely.</p>

<p>In another letter to Madame d’Épinay, dated at
Naples, 18th May, 1776, he had already foretold the
success of our Revolution. Few prophets have been
more explicit than he was in the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Livy said of his age, which so strongly resembled ours,
‘<i>Ad hæc tempora ventum est, quibus nec vitia nostra nec
remedia pati possumus</i>,’&mdash;‘We are in an age when the
remedies hurt at least as much as the vices.’<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> Do you
know how matters stand? <em>The epoch has come of the total
downfall of Europe, and of transmigration to America.</em>
Everything here is falling into rottenness,&mdash;religion, laws,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
arts, sciences,&mdash;and everything is going to be rebuilt anew
in America. This is no joke; nor is it an idea drawn from
the English quarrels; I have said, announced, preached it,
for more than twenty years, and I have always seen my
prophecies fulfilled. <em>Do not buy your house, then, in the
Chaussée d’Antin; you must buy it in Philadelphia.</em> My
trouble is, that there are no abbeys in America.”<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This letter was written some months before the
Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>In another, dated at Naples, 7th February, 1778,
the Abbé alludes to the great numbers of English men
and women who have come to Naples “for shelter from
the American tempests,” and adds, “Meanwhile the
Washingtons and Hancocks will be fatal to them.”<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>
In still another, dated at Naples, 25th July, 1778,
he renews his prophecies in language still more explicit:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You will at this time have decided the greatest revolution
of the globe,&mdash;namely, <em>if it is America which is to
reign over Europe, or if it is Europe which is to continue to
reign over America</em>. I would wager in favor of America, for
the reason, merely physical, that for five thousand years
genius has turned opposite to the diurnal motion, and travelled
from East to West.”<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here again is the idea of Berkeley which has been
so captivating.</p>

<h4>ADAM SMITH, 1776.</h4>

<p>In contrast with the witty Italian is the illustrious
philosopher and writer of Scotland, Adam Smith, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
was born 5th June, 1723, and died 17th July, 1790.
His fame is so commanding that any details of life or
works would be out of place. He was thinker and
inventor, through whom mankind was advanced in
knowledge.</p>

<p>I say nothing of his “Theory of Moral Sentiments,”
constituting an important contribution to the science of
Ethics, but come at once to his great work of political
economy, entitled “An Inquiry into the Nature and
Causes of the Wealth of Nations,” which first appeared
in 1776. Its publication marks an epoch described by
Mr. Buckle, when he says that Adam Smith, “by the
publication of this single work, contributed more towards
the happiness of man than has been effected by
the united abilities of all the statesmen and legislators
of whom history has preserved an authentic account.”<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
The work is full of prophetic knowledge, and especially
with regard to the British Colonies. Writing while the
debate with the mother country was still pending, Adam
Smith urged that they should be admitted to Parliamentary
representation in proportion to taxation, so that
their representation would enlarge with their growing
resources; and here he predicts nothing less than the
transfer of empire:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The distance of America from the seat of government,
the natives of that country might flatter themselves, with
some appearance of reason too, would not be of very long
continuance. Such has hitherto been the rapid progress of
that country in wealth, population, and improvement, that,
in the course of little more than a century, perhaps, the
produce of American might exceed that of British taxation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
<em>The seat of the empire would then naturally remove itself to
that part of the empire which contributed most to the general
defence and support of the whole.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In these tranquil words of assured science the great
author carries the seat of government across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Did Adam Smith in this remarkable passage do more
than follow a hint from our own prophet? The prophecy
of the great economist first appeared in 1776. In
the course of 1774, and down to April 19, 1775, John
Adams published in the “Boston Gazette” a series of
weekly articles, under the signature of “Novanglus,”
which were abridged in Almon’s “Remembrancer” for
1775, with the following title: “History of the Dispute
with America, from its Origin in 1754 to the
Present Time.” Although this abridged edition stops
before the prophetic passage, it is not impossible that
the whole series was known to Adam Smith. After
speculating, as the latter did afterwards, on the extension
of the British Constitution and Parliamentary
representation to the outlying British dominions, our
prophet says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If in twenty years more America should have six millions
of inhabitants, as there is a boundless territory to
fill up, she must have five hundred representatives. Upon
these principles, if in forty years she should have twelve
millions, a thousand; and if the inhabitants of the three
kingdoms remain as they are, being already full of inhabitants,
what will become of your supreme legislative? <em>It will
be translated, crown and all, to America.</em> This is a sublime
system for America. It will flatter those ideas of independency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
which the Tories impute to them, if they have any
such, more than any other plan of independency that I have
ever heard projected.”<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus plainly was John Adams precursor of Adam
Smith.</p>

<p>In 1784 these papers were reprinted from the “Remembrancer,”
by Stockdale, in London, bearing the same
title, substantially, as before, “History of the Dispute
with America, from its Origin in 1754,” with the addition,
“Written in the Year 1774, by John Adams,
Esq.” The “Monthly Review,” in a notice of the publication,
after speaking of “the inauspicious system of
American taxation,” says, “Mr. Adams foretold the consequence
of obstinately adhering to it, and the event
hath too well verified his predictions. They were, however,
predictions which required no inspiration.”<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> So
that his wise second-sight was recognized in England
much beyond the prevision of Adam Smith.</p>

<p>The idea of transferring the seat of government to
America was often attributed to Franklin by Dean
Tucker. The former, in a letter, as early as 25th November,
1767, reports the Dean as saying, “That is
his constant plan.”<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> In one of his tracts, the Dean
attributes it not only to Franklin, but also to our
people. With strange exaggeration he says: “It has
been the unanimous opinion of the North Americans
for these fifty years past, that the seat of empire ought
to be transferred from the lesser to the greater country,&mdash;that
is, from England to America, or, as Dr. Franklin
elegantly phrased it, from the cock-boat to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
man-of-war.”<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> It is impossible to say how much of this
was from the excited brain of the Dean.</p>

<h4>RICHARD PRICE, 1776, 1777, 1778, 1784.</h4>

<p>A true and solid ally of our country at a critical
period was Dr. Price, dissenting clergyman, metaphysician,
political writer, and mathematician, who was
born in Wales, 23d February, 1723, and died in London,
19th April, 1791.</p>

<p>His earliest labors were “A Review of the Principal
Questions and Difficulties in Morals,” by which he was
recognized as a metaphysician, and “Observations on
Reversionary Payments,” by which he was recognized
as an authority on a large class of financial questions.
At the same time his sermons were regarded as excellent.
Amidst these various labors he was moved to
enlist as a pamphleteer in defence of the American
Colonies. This service, prompted by a generous devotion
to just principles, awakened grateful sentiments
on both sides of the ocean.</p>

<p>The Aldermen and Common Council of London
marked their sympathy by voting him the freedom
of the city in a gold box of fifty pounds value. The
American Congress sent him a different testimonial,
officially communicated to him, being a solemn resolution
declaring “the desire of Congress to consider
him a citizen of the United States, and to receive his
assistance in regulating their finances.”<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> In reply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
under date of 18th January, 1779, while declining the
invitation, he offered “assurances that Dr. Price feels
the warmest gratitude for the notice taken of him, and
that he looks to the American States as <em>now</em> the hope
and likely <em>soon</em> to become the refuge of mankind.”<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>
Franklin and Adams contracted with him relations of
friendship. The former, under date of 6th February,
1780, wrote him: “Your writings, after all the abuse
you and they have met with, begin to make serious
impressions on those who at first rejected the counsels
you gave”;<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> and 24th October, 1788, he wrote
to another: “Remember me affectionately to good Dr.
Price.”<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> The latter, in correspondence many years
afterwards, recorded the intimacy he enjoyed with Dr.
Price, “at his own house, at my house, and at the
houses and tables of many friends.”<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p>The first of his American tracts was in 1776, being
“Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty, the Principles
of Government, and the Justice and Policy of
the War with America.” The sale of sixty thousand
copies in a few months shows the extensive acceptance
of the work. The general principles so clearly
exhibited are invoked for America. Occasionally the
philosopher becomes prophet, as when he predicts the
growth of population:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They are now but little short of half our number. To
this number they have grown, from a small body of original
settlers, by a very rapid increase. The probability is
that they will go on to increase, and that in fifty or sixty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
years they will be <em>double our number, and form a mighty
empire, consisting of a variety of States, all equal or superior
to ourselves in all the arts and accomplishments which give
dignity and happiness to human life</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nothing less than “a vast continent” seems to him
the sphere of this remarkable development, and he revolts
at the idea of this being held “at the discretion
of a handful of people on the other side of the Atlantic.”<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>
In the measures which brought on the war
he saw “the hand of Providence <em>working to bring about
some great ends</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> And the vast continent was to be
dedicated to Liberty. The excellent man saw even
the end of Slavery. Speaking of “the negroes of the
Southern Colonies,” he said that they “probably will
now either soon become extinct or <em>have their condition
changed into that of freemen</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> Years and battle intervened
before this precious result.</p>

<p>This production was followed in 1777 by “Additional
Observations on the Nature and Value of Civil Liberty,
and the War with America,”&mdash;to which was added
“Observations on Public Loans, the National Debt, and
the Debts and Resources of France.” In all this variety
of topics, his concern for America breaks forth in the
inquiry, “Must not humanity shudder at such a war?”<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>
And he sees untold loss to England, which, with the
Colonies, “might be the greatest and happiest nation
that ever existed”; but without them “we are no more a
people; … our existence depends on keeping them.”<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>
This patriotic gloom is checked by another vision:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These measures have, in all probability, hastened that
disruption of the New from the Old World, <em>which will begin
a new era in the annals of mankind</em>, and produce a revolution
more important, perhaps, than any that has happened
in human affairs.”<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus was American Independence heralded, and its
influence foretold.</p>

<p>Constantly sympathizing with America, and impressed
by the magnitude of the issue, his soul found
another utterance, in 1778, in what he called “The
General Introduction and Supplement to the Two
Tracts on Civil Liberty, the War with America, and
the Finances of the Kingdom.” Here again he sees a
vision:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A great people, likely to be formed, in spite of all our
efforts, into free communities, under governments which
have no religious tests and establishments. A new era in
future annals, and a new opening in human affairs, beginning,
among the descendants of Englishmen, in a new
world. <em>A rising empire, extended over an immense continent,
without bishops, without nobles, and without kings.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

</div>

<p>After the recognition of Independence and the establishment
of peace, Dr. Price appeared with another
tract: “Observations on the Importance of the American
Revolution and the Means of making it a Benefit
to the World.” This was in 1784. And here he repeated
the exultation of an earlier day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“With heartfelt satisfaction I see the revolution in favor
of universal liberty which has taken place in America,&mdash;<em>a
revolution which opens a new prospect in human affairs</em>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
begins a new era in the history of mankind.… Perhaps
I do not go too far, when I say, that, next to the introduction
of Christianity among mankind, the American Revolution
may prove the most important step in the progressive
course of human improvement.”<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus announcing the grandeur of the epoch, he states
that it “may produce a general diffusion of the principles
of humanity,” and may lead mankind to see and
know “that all legitimate government consists in the
dominion of <em>equal laws</em>, made with common consent,”
which is another expression of the primal truth of the
Declaration of Independence. Then, referring to the
“community or confederacy” of States, he says, “I can
almost imagine that it is not impossible but that by
such means <em>universal peace</em> may be produced, and all
war excluded from the world”; and he asks, “Why
may we not hope to see this begun in America?”<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>
May America be true to this aspiration! There is also
a longing for Equality, and a warning against Slavery,
with the ejaculation, in harmony with earlier words,
“Let the United States continue forever what it is now
their glory to be, a confederation of States, prosperous
and happy, <em>without lords, without bishops, and without
kings</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> In the midst of the bloody conflict this vision
had appeared, and he had sought to make it a reality.</p>

<p>His true friendship for our country and his devotion
to humanity, with the modesty of his nature, appear in
a letter to Franklin, 12th July, 1784, communicating a
copy of the last production. After saying that “it is
intended entirely for America,” the excellent counsellor
proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I hope the United States will forgive my presumption in
supposing myself qualified to advise them.… The consciousness
which I have that it is well intended, and that my
address to them is the effusion of a heart that wishes to serve
the best interests of society, helps to reconcile me to myself in
this instance, and it will, I hope, engage the candor of others.”<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The same sentiments which proved his sympathies
with our country reappeared with fresh fires at the outbreak
of the French Revolution, arousing, in opposition,
the immortal eloquence of Burke. A discourse “On the
Love of our Country,” preached at the Old Jewry, 4th
November, 1789, in commemoration of the English Revolution,
with friendly glances at what was then passing
across the Channel, prompted the “Reflections on
the Revolution in France.” The personal denunciation
which is the beginning of that remarkable performance
is the perpetual witness to the position of the preacher,
whose prophetic soul did not hesitate to accept the
French Revolution side by side with ours in glory and
in promise.</p>

<h4>GOVERNOR POWNALL, 1777, 1780, 1783.</h4>

<p>Among the best friends of our country abroad during
the trials of the Revolution was Thomas Pownall, called
by one biographer “a learned antiquary and politician,”
and by another “an English statesman and author.”
Latterly he has so far dropped out of sight that there
are few who recognize in him either of these characters.
He was born 1722, and died at Bath 1805. During
this long period he held several offices. As early as
1745 he became secretary to the Commissioners for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
Trade and Plantations. In 1753 he crossed the ocean.
In 1755, as Commissioner for Massachusetts Bay, he
had a share in the negotiations with New York, New
Jersey, and Pennsylvania, in union with New England,
which resulted in the confederated expedition against
Crown Point. He was afterwards Governor of Massachusetts
Bay, New Jersey, and South Carolina, successively.
Returning to England, he was appointed, in
1762, Comptroller-General of the army in Germany,
with the military rank of colonel. He sat in two successive
Parliaments until 1780, when he passed into
private life. Hildreth gives a glimpse of his personal
character, when, admitting his frank manners and liberal
politics, he describes his habits as “rather freer
than suited the New England standard.”<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p>Pownall stands forth conspicuous for championship
of our national independence, and especially for foresight
with regard to our national future. In both these
respects his writings are unique. Other Englishmen
were in favor of independence, and saw our future
also; but I doubt if any one can be named who was
his equal in strenuous action, or in minuteness of foresight.
While the war was still proceeding, as early
as 1780, he openly announced, not only that independence
was inevitable, but that the new nation,
“founded in Nature and built up in truth,” would continually
expand; that its population would increase
and multiply; that a civilizing activity beyond what
Europe could ever know would animate it; and that
its commercial and naval power would be found in
every quarter of the globe.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> All this he set forth at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
length with argument and illustration, and he called
his prophetic words “the <em>stating of the simple fact</em>, so
little understood in the Old World.” Treated at first
as “unintelligible speculation” and as “unfashionable,”
the truth he announced was “neglected where it was
not rejected, but in general rejected as inadmissible,”
and the author, according to his own language, “was
called by the wise men of the British Cabinet <em>a Wild
Man</em>, unfit to be employed.”<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> But these writings are a
better title now than any office. In manner they are
diffuse and pedantic; but they hardly deserve the cold
judgment of John Adams, who in his old age said of
them that “a reader who has patience to search for
good sense in an uncouth and disgusting style will
find in those writings proofs of a thinking mind.”<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<p>He seems to have written a good deal. But the
works which will be remembered the longest are not
even mentioned by several of his biographers. Rose,
in his Biographical Dictionary, records works by him,
entitled “Antiquities of the Provincia Romana of Gaul”;
“Roman Antiquities dug up at Bath”; “Observations
on the Currents in the Atlantic Ocean”; “Intellectual
Physics”; and contributions to the “Archæologia”:
nothing more. To this list Gorton, in his Biographical
Dictionary, adds briefly, “besides many political tracts,”
but without particular reference to the works on America.
This is another instance where the stone rejected
by the builders becomes the head of the corner.</p>

<p>At an early date Pownall comprehended the position
of our country, geographically. He saw the wonderful
means of internal communication supplied by its inland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
waters, and also the opportunities of external commerce
afforded by the Atlantic Ocean. On the former he dwells,
in a Memorial drawn up in 1756 for the Duke of Cumberland.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
Nobody in our own day, after the experience
of more than a century, has portrayed more vividly the
two vast aqueous masses,&mdash;one composed of the Great
Lakes and their dependencies, and the other of the Mississippi
and its tributaries. The Great Lakes are described
as “a wilderness of waters, spreading over the
country by an infinite number and variety of branchings,
bays, straits, &amp;c.”<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> The Mississippi, with its eastern
branch, called the Ohio, is described as having, “as
far as we know, but two falls,&mdash;one at a place called
by the French St. Antoine, high up on the west or main
branch”; and all its waters “run to the ocean with a
still, easy, and gentle current.”<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> The picture is completed
by exhibiting the two masses in combination:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The waters of each respective mass&mdash;not only the lesser
streams, but the main general body of each going through
this continent in every course and direction&mdash;have, by their
approach to each other, by their interlacing with each other,
by their communication to every quarter and in every direction,
an alliance and unity, and form one mass, a one whole.”<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And he remarks, that it is thus seen</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“how the watery element claims and holds dominion over
this extent of land: that the great lakes which lie upon its
bosom on one hand, and the great river Mississippi and the
multitude of waters which run into it, form there a communication,&mdash;an
alliance or dominion of the watery element, that
commands throughout the whole; that these great lakes appear
to be <em>the throne</em>, the <em>centre of a dominion</em>, whose influence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
by an infinite number of rivers, creeks, and streams,
extends itself through all and every part of the continent,
supported by the communication of, and alliance with, the
waters of Mississippi.”<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

</div>

<p>If these means of internal commerce were vast, those
afforded by the Atlantic Ocean were not less extensive.
The latter were developed in the treatise on “The Administration
of the Colonies,” the fourth edition of which,
published in 1768, is now before me. This was after
the differences between the Colonies and the mother
country had begun, but before the idea of independence
had shown itself. Pownall insisted that the Colonies
ought to be considered as parts of the realm, entitled
to representation in Parliament. This was a constitutional
unity. But he portrayed a commercial unity also,
which he represented in attractive forms. The British
Isles, and the British possessions in the Atlantic and
in America, were, according to him, “a grand marine
dominion,” and ought, therefore, by policy, to be united
into one empire, with one centre. On this he dwells at
length, and the picture is presented repeatedly.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> It was
incident to the crisis in the world produced by the predominance
of the commercial spirit already beginning to
rule the powers of Europe. It was the duty of England
to place herself at the head of this great movement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As the rising of this crisis above described forms precisely
the <em>object</em> on which Government should be employed,
so the taking leading measures towards the forming all those
Atlantic and American possessions into one empire, of which
Great Britain should be the commercial and political centre,
is the <em>precise duty</em> of Government at this crisis.”<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p>This was his desire. But he saw clearly the resources
as well as the rights of the Colonies, and was satisfied,
that, if power were not consolidated under the constitutional
auspices of England, it would be transferred
to the other side of the Atlantic. Here his words are
prophetic:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The whole train of events, the whole course of business,
must perpetually bring forward into practice, and necessarily
in the end into establishment, <em>either an American or a British
union</em>. There is no other alternative.”<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The necessity for union is enforced in a manner
which foreshadows our National Union:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Colonial Legislature does certainly not answer all
purposes,&mdash;is incompetent and inadequate to many purposes.
Something, therefore, more is necessary,&mdash;<em>either a
common union amongst themselves</em>, or a one common union
of subordination under the one general legislature of the
state.”<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then, again, in another place of the same work, after
representing the declarations of power over the Colonies
as little better than mockery, he prophesies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Such is the actual state of the really existing system
of our dominions, that <em>neither the power of government over
these various parts can long continue under the present mode of
administration</em>, nor the great interest of commerce extended
throughout the whole long subsist under the present system
of the laws of trade.”<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Recent events may give present interest to his views,
in this same work, on the nature and necessity of a
paper currency, where he follows Franklin. The principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
points of his plan were: That bills of credit, to a
certain amount, should be printed in England for the
use of the Colonies; that a loan-office should be established
in each Colony, to issue bills, take securities, and
receive the payments; that the bills should be issued
for ten years, bearing interest at five per cent.,&mdash;one
tenth part of the sum borrowed to be paid annually,
with the interest; and that they should be a legal
tender.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>When the differences had flamed forth in war, then
the prophet became more earnest. His utterances deserve
to be rescued from oblivion. He was open, almost
defiant. As early as 2d December, 1777, some months
before our treaty with France, he declared, from his
place in Parliament, that “the sovereignty of this country
over America is abolished and gone forever”; that
“they are determined at all events to be independent,
<em>and they will be so</em>”; and that “all the treaty that this
country can ever expect with America is federal, and
that, probably, only commercial.” In this spirit he said
to the House:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Until you shall be convinced that you are no longer sovereigns
over America, but that the United States are an independent,
sovereign people,&mdash;until you are prepared to treat
with them as such,&mdash;it is of no consequence at all what
schemes or plans of conciliation this side the House or that
may adopt.”<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The position taken in Parliament he maintained by
writings; and here he depicted the great destinies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
our country. He began with “A Memorial to the
Sovereigns of Europe,” published early in 1780, and
afterwards, through the influence of John Adams, while
at the Hague, abridged and translated into French. In
this remarkable production independence was the least
that he claimed for us. Thus he foretells our future:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“North America is become a new primary planet in the
system of the world, which, while it takes its own course, in
its own orbit, must have effect on the orbit of every other
planet, and shift the common centre of gravity of the whole
system of the European world. North America is <i>de facto</i>
an independent power, which has taken its equal station with
other powers, and must be so <i>de jure</i>.… The independence
of America is fixed as Fate. She is mistress of her own
fortune, knows that she is so, and will actuate that power
which she feels she hath, so as to establish her own system
<em>and to change the system of Europe</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Not only is the new power to take an independent
place, but it is “to change the system of Europe.” For
all this its people are amply prepared. “Standing on
that high ground of improvement up to which the most
enlightened parts of Europe have advanced, like eaglets
they commence the first efforts of their pinions from a
towering advantage.”<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> This same conviction appears
in another form:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“North America has advanced and is every day advancing
to growth of state with a steady and continually accelerating
motion, of which there has never yet been any example in
Europe.”<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> “It is a vitality, liable indeed to many disorders,
many dangerous diseases; but it is young and strong, and
will struggle, by the vigor of internal healing principles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
life, against those evils, and surmount them.… Its strength
will grow with its years.”<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He then dwells in detail on “the progressive population”
of the country; on its advantage in lying “on
another side of the globe, where it has no enemy”; on
the products of the soil, among which is “bread-corn to
a degree that has wrought it to a staple export for the
supply of the Old World”; on the fisheries, which he
calls “mines producing more solid riches to those who
work them than all the silver of Potosi”; on the inventive
spirit of the people; and on their commercial
activity.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Of such a people it is easy to predict great
things; and our prophet announces,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That the new state will be “a great naval power,”
exercising a peculiar influence on commerce, and, through
commerce, on the political system of the Old World,&mdash;becoming
the arbitress of commerce, and perhaps the
mediatrix of peace.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>2. That ship-building and the science and art of navigation
have made such progress in America that her
people will be able to build and navigate cheaper than
any country in Europe, even Holland, with all her
economy.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>3. That the peculiar articles to be had from America
only, and so much sought in Europe, must give Americans
a preference in those markets.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>4. That a people “whose empire stands singly predominant
in a great continent” can hardly “suffer in
their borders the establishment of such a monopoly as
the European Hudson’s Bay Company”; that it cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
be stopped by Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope;
that before long “they will be found trading in the
South Sea and in China”; and that “the Dutch will
hear of them in Spice Islands.”<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

<p>5. That by constant intercommunion of business and
correspondence, and by increased knowledge with regard
to the ocean, “America will seem every day to
approach nearer and nearer to Europe”; that “a thousand
attractive motives will … become the irresistible
cause of <em>an almost general emigration to that New
World</em>”; and that “many of the most useful, enterprising
spirits, and much of the active property, will go
there also.”<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>6. That “North America will become a <em>free port</em> to
all the nations of the world indiscriminately, and will
expect, insist on, and demand, in fair reciprocity, a <em>free
market</em> in all those nations with whom she trades”;
and that, adhering to this principle, she must be, “in
the course of time, the chief carrier of the commerce
of the whole world.”<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>7. That America must avoid complication with European
politics, or “the entanglement of alliances,” having
no connections with Europe “other than merely commercial”;<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>&mdash;all
of which at a later day was put forth
by Washington in his Farewell Address, when he said:
“The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign
nations, is, in extending our commercial relations, to
have with them as little political connection as possible”;
and also when he asked: “Why, by interweaving
our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
our peace and prosperity in the toils of European
ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?”<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>8. That “the similar modes of living and thinking,
the same manners and same fashions, the same language,
and old habits of national love, impressed in the heart
and not yet effaced, <em>the very indentings of the fracture
whereat North America stands broken off from England,
all conspire naturally to a rejuncture by alliance</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p>9. That the sovereigns of Europe, who “have despised
the unfashioned, awkward youth of America,” and have
neglected to interweave their interests with the rising
States, when they find the system of the new empire
not only obstructing, but superseding, the old system
of Europe, and crossing all their settled maxims, will
call upon their ministers and wise men, “Come, curse
me this people, for they are too mighty for me.”<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<p>This remarkable appeal was followed by two Memorials,
“drawn up solely for the King’s use, and designed
solely for his eye,”<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> dated at Richmond, January 2,
1782, where the author most persuasively urges his
Majesty to “treat with the Americans as with free states
<i>de facto</i>, under a truce.”<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> And on the signature of the
treaty of peace he wrote a private letter to Franklin,
dated at Richmond, 28th February, 1783, where he testifies
to the magnitude of the event:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My old Friend</span>,&mdash;I write this to congratulate you on
the establishment of your country as a free and sovereign
power, taking its equal station amongst the powers of this
world. I congratulate you, in particular, as chosen by Providence
to be a principal instrument of this great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
Revolution,&mdash;<em>a Revolution that has stronger marks of Divine interposition,
superseding the ordinary course of human affairs, than
any other event which this world has experienced</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The prophet closes his letter by allusion to a proposed
tour of America, adding, that, “if there ever was
an object worth the travelling to see, and worthy of the
contemplation of a philosopher, it is that in which he
may see the beginnings of a great empire at its foundation.”
He communicated this purpose also to John
Adams, who answered him, that “he would be received
respectfully in every part of America, that he had always
been considered as friendly to America, and that
his writings had been useful to our cause.”<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>Then came another work, first published in 1783,
entitled “A Memorial addressed to the Sovereigns of
America,” of which he gave the mistaken judgment to
a private friend, that it was “the best thing he ever
wrote.”<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> Here for the first time American citizens
are called “sovereigns.” At the beginning he explains,
and indicates the simplicity with which he addresses
them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Having presumed to address to the Sovereigns of Europe
a Memorial, … permit me now to address this Memorial
to you Sovereigns of America. I shall not address you with
the court titles of Gothic Europe, nor with those of servile
Asia. I will neither address your Sublimity or Majesty,
your Grace or Holiness, your Eminence or Highmightiness,
your Excellence or Honors. What are titles, where things
themselves are known and understood? What title did the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
Republic of Rome take? The state was known to be sovereign,
and the citizens to be free. What could add to this
glory? Therefore, United States and Citizens of America, I
address you as you are.”<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here again are the same constant sympathy with
Liberty, the same confidence in our national destinies,
and the same aspirations for our prosperity, mingled
with warnings against disturbing influences. He exhorts
that all our foundations should be “laid in Nature”;
that there should be “no contention for, nor
acquisition of, unequal domination in men”; and that
union should be established on the attractive principle
by which all are drawn to a common centre.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> He fears
difficulty in making the line of frontier between us and
the British Provinces “a line of peace,” as it ought to
be; he is anxious lest something may break out between
us and Spain; and he suggests that possibly, “in the
cool hours of unimpassioned reflection,” we may learn
the danger of our “alliances,”<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>&mdash;referring plainly to
that original alliance with France which at a later day
was the occasion of such trouble. Two other warnings
occur. One is against Slavery,<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> which is more memorable,
because in an earlier Memorial he enumerates
among articles of commerce “African slaves, carried by
a circuitous trade in American shipping to the West
India markets.”<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> The other warning is thus strongly
expressed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Every inhabitant of America is, <i>de facto</i> as well as <i>de
jure</i>, equal, in his essential, inseparable rights of the individual,
to any other individual,&mdash;is, in these rights, independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
of any power that any other can assume over him,
over his labor, or his property. This is a principle in act
and deed, and not a mere speculative theorem.”<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This strange and striking testimony, all from one
man, is enhanced by his farewell words to Franklin.
As Pownall heard that the great philosopher and negotiator
was about to embark for the United States,
he wrote to him from Lausanne, 3d July, 1785:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Adieu, my dear friend. You are going to a New World,
formed to exhibit a scene which the Old World never yet
saw. You leave me here in the Old World, which, like myself,
begins to feel, as Asia hath felt, that it is wearing out
apace. We shall never meet again on this earth; but there
is another world where we shall meet, and <em>where we shall be
understood</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The correspondence was continued across the intervening
ocean. In a letter to Franklin, dated at Bristol,
8th April, 1788, the same devoted reformer refers
to the Congress at Albany in 1754, “when the events
which have since come into fact first began to develop
themselves, as ready to burst into bloom, and to bring
forth the fruits of Liberty which you in America at
present enjoy.” He is cheered in his old age by the
proceedings in the Convention to frame a Constitution,
with Franklin’s “report of a system of sovereignty
founded in law, and above which law only was sovereign”;
and he begins “to entertain hopes for the liberties
of America, and for what will be an asylum one
day or other to a remnant of mankind who wish and
deserve to live with political liberty.” His disturbance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
at the Presidential term breaks out: “I have some fears
of mischief from <em>the orbit of four years’ period</em> which
you give to the rotation of the office of President. It
may become the ground of intrigue.”<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> Here friendly
anxiety is elevated by hope, where America appears as
the asylum of Liberty.</p>

<p>Clearly Pownall was not understood in his time; but
it is evident that he understood our country as few Englishmen
since have been able to understand it.</p>

<p>How few of his contemporaries saw America with his
insight and courage! The prevailing sentiment was
typified in the conduct of George the Third, so boldly
arraigned in the Declaration of Independence. Individual
opinions also attest the contrast, and help to
glorify Pownall. Thus, Shirley, like himself a Massachusetts
governor, in advising the King to strengthen
Louisburg, wrote, under date of July 10, 1745:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It would, by its vicinity to the British Colonies, and
being the key of ’em, give the Crown of Great Britain a
most absolute hold and command of ’em, if ever there should
come a time when they should go restiff and disposed to
shake off their dependency upon their mother country, <em>the
possibility of which seems some centuries further off than it
does to some gentlemen at home</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>Nothing of the prophet here. Nor was Hume more
penetrating in his History first published, although he
commemorates properly the early settlement of the
country:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What chiefly renders the reign of James memorable is
the commencement of the English colonies in America, colonies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
established on the noblest footing that has been known
in any age or nation.…</p>

<p>“Speculative reasoners during that age raised many objections
to the planting those remote colonies, and foretold,
that, after draining their mother country of inhabitants, they
would soon shake off her yoke, and erect an independent
government in America; but time has shown that the views
entertained by those who encouraged such generous undertakings
were more just and solid. <em>A mild government and
great naval force have preserved, and may long preserve, the
dominion of England over her colonies.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In making the reign of James chiefly memorable by
the Colonies, the eminent historian shows a just appreciation
of events; but he seems to have written hastily,
and rather from imagination than evidence, when he
announces contemporary prophecy, “that, after draining
their mother country of inhabitants, they would
soon shake off her yoke, and erect an independent
government in America,” and is plainly without prophetic
instinct with regard to “the dominion of England
over her colonies.”</p>

<h4>CÉRISIER, 1778, 1780.</h4>

<p>Again a Frenchman appears on our list, Antoine
Marie Cérisier, who was born at Châtillon-les-Dombes,
1749, and died 1st July, 1828, after a checkered existence.
Being Secretary of the French Legation at the
Hague, he early became interested in the history of
Holland and her heroic struggle for independence. An
elaborate work in ten volumes on the “General History<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
of the United Provinces,”<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> appearing first in French
and afterwards translated into Dutch, attests his industry
and zeal, and down to this day is accepted as the
best in French literature on this interesting subject.
Naturally the historian of the mighty effort to overthrow
the domination of Spain sympathized with the
kindred effort in America. In a series of works he
bore his testimony to our cause.</p>

<p>John Adams was received at the Hague as American
Minister, 19th April, 1782. In his despatch to Secretary
Livingston, 16th May, 1782, he wrote: “How
shall I mention another gentleman, whose name, perhaps,
Congress never heard, but who, in my opinion,
has done more decided and essential service to the
American cause and reputation, within these last eighteen
months, than any other man in Europe?” Then,
after describing him as “beyond all contradiction one
of the greatest historians and political characters in
Europe, … possessed of the most genuine principles
and sentiments of liberty, and exceedingly devoted
by principle and affection to the American cause,” our
minister announces: “His pen has erected a monument
to the American cause more glorious and more durable
than brass or marble. His writings have been read like
oracles, and his sentiments weekly echoed and reëchoed
in gazettes and pamphlets.”<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> And yet these have passed
out of sight.</p>

<p>First in time was an elaborate work in French, purporting
to be translated from the English, which appeared
at Utrecht in 1778, entitled, “History of the
Founding of the Colonies of the Ancient Republics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
adapted to the present Dispute of Great Britain with
her American Colonies.”<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> Learning and philosophy
were elevated by visions of the future. With the
representation of the Colonies in Parliament, he foresees
the time when “the influence of America will
become preponderant in Parliament, and <em>able, perhaps,
to transfer the seat of empire</em> to their country,
and so, without danger and without convulsive agitation,
render this immense continent, already so favorably
disposed by Nature to that end, the theatre of
one of the greatest and freest governments that have
ever existed.”<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> Then indulging in another vision,
where French emigrants and Canadians, already invited
to enter the Confederacy, mingle with English
colonists, he beholds at the head of the happy settlements
“men known for their superior genius, their politics
friendly to humanity, and their enthusiasm for
liberty,” and he catches the strains of ancient dramatists,
“whose masterpieces would breathe and inspire
a hatred of tyrants and despots.” Then touching a
practical point in government, he exclaims: “The human
species there would not be debased, outraged by
that odious and barbarous distinction of nobles and
plebeians, as if anybody could be more or less than a
man.” And then again: “Could not that admirable
democracy which I have so often pleased myself in
tracing be established there?”<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p>This was followed in the same year by another publication,
also in French, entitled “Impartial Observations
of a True Hollander, in Answer to the Address<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
of a self-styled Good Hollander to his Countrymen.”<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>
Here there is no longer question of Colonial representation
in Parliament, or of British empire transferred
to America, but of separation, with its lofty future:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This revolution is, then, the most fortunate event which
could happen to the human species in general and to all the
States in particular. In short, tender souls see with transport
that reparation at last is to be made for the crime of
those who discovered and devastated this immense continent,
and recognize the United States of North America as replacing
the numerous nations which European cruelty has caused
to disappear from South America.”<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Addressing Englishmen directly, the Frenchman thus
counsels:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Englishmen! you must needs submit to your destiny,
and renounce a people who do not wish longer to recognize
you. To avoid giving them any uneasiness, and to prevent
all dispute in the future, <em>have the courage to abandon to them
all the neighboring countries which have not yet shaken off
your yoke</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then turning to his own countrymen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<em>Let Canada make a fourteenth confederate State.</em> What
glory for you to have labored first for this interesting revolution!
What glory for you that these settlements, sprung
from your bosom, should be associated with a powerful confederation,
and govern themselves as a Republic!”<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The idea of Canada as “a fourteenth confederate
State” was in unison with the aspiration and invitation
of the Continental Congress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p>Another friendly work in French, pretending to be
from the English, saw the light in 1780, and is entitled
“The Destiny of America; or, Picturesque Dialogues.”<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>
Among the parties to the colloquies are Lord North,
with other English personages, and a Philosopher, who
must be the author. Among the topics considered are
the causes of current events, the policy of European
powers relative to the war, and the influence it must
have on the happiness of mankind. In answer to Lord
North, who asks, “What are these precious means [of
saving our honor and interests]?” the Philosopher replies:
“Commence by proclaiming the independence of
the thirteen revolted Colonies, of Florida, <em>and of Canada</em>;
… then, in a manner not less solemn, renounce
Jamaica, Barbadoes, and all your Windward Islands.”<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>
This is to be followed by the freedom of the Spanish
and French colonies,&mdash;also of the Dutch, the Portuguese,
and the Danish. Then, rising in aspiration, the
Philosopher, exalting the good of humanity over that of
any nation, proclaims that the root of future wars must
be destroyed, that the ocean may not be reddened with
blood; but this destiny will be postponed, “if America
does not become entirely free.”<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> Then, looking forward
to the time when nations will contend on the ocean
only in commercial activity, and man will cease to be
the greatest enemy of man, he declares: “If Perpetual
Peace could be more than the dream of honest men,
what event could accelerate it more than the independence
of the two Americas?”<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> Confessing that he does
not expect the applause of the present age, he concludes,
“My heart tells me that I shall have the acknowledgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
of all free and tender souls, and the suffrage of
posterity.”<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> Most surely he has mine. Nothing can
be happier than the thought that Perpetual Peace would
be accelerated by American freedom, thus enhancing
even this great boon.</p>

<h4>SIR WILLIAM JONES, 1781.</h4>

<p>I am glad to enter upon our list the name of this
illustrious scholar, who was born in London, 28th September,
1746, and died in Calcutta, 27th April, 1794.</p>

<p>If others have excelled Sir William Jones in different
departments of human activity, no Englishman has
attained equal eminence in so many, and at the same
time borne the priceless crown of character. His wonderful
attainments and his various genius excite admiration,
but his goodness awakens love. It is pleasant to
know that his benediction rests upon our country.</p>

<p>From boyhood to his last breath he was always industrious,
thus helping the generous gifts of Nature,&mdash;and
it is not easy to say where he was most eminent.
As a jurist, he is memorable for the “Essay on the Law
of Bailments,” undoubtedly at the time it appeared the
most complete and beautiful contribution to the science
of jurisprudence in the English language. As a judge,
he was the voice of the law and of justice, so that his
appointment to a high judicial station in India was
called “the greatest blessing ever conferred by the British
Government on the inhabitants of the East.”<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> As a
linguist, knowing no less than twenty-eight languages,
he was the predecessor of Baron William Humboldt, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
the less scholarly prodigy, Mezzofanti, while as a philologist
he will find a parallel in the former rather than
the latter. As an Orientalist, he was not only the first
of his time, but the pioneer through whom the literature
of the East was opened to European study and curiosity.
As a poet, he is enshrined forever by his Ode modestly
called “An Ode in Imitation of Alcæus,”<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> and doubtless
inspired by sympathy with the American cause:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>To all these accomplishments add the glowing emotions
of his noble nature, his love of virtue, his devotion
to freedom, his sympathy for the poor and downtrodden.
His biographer records as “a favorite opinion
of Sir William Jones, that all men are born with <em>an
equal capacity for improvement</em>,”<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> and also reports him
as saying: “I see chiefly under the sun the two classes
of men whom Solomon describes, the oppressor and the
oppressed.… I shall cultivate my fields and gardens,
and think as little as possible of monarchs or oligarchs.”<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
With these declarations it is easy to credit Dr. Paley,
who said of him, “He was a great republican when I
knew him.”<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> Like seeks like, and a long intimacy in
the family of the good Bishop of St. Asaph,<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> ending in
a happy marriage with his eldest daughter, shows how
he must have sympathized with the American cause and
with the future of our country.</p>

<p>Our author had been the tutor of Lord Althorp, the
same who, as Earl Spencer, became so famous a bibliophile
and a patron of Dibdin, and on the marriage of
his pupil with Miss Lavinia Bingham, he was moved
to commemorate it in a poem, entitled “The Muse Recalled:
an Ode on the Nuptials of Lord Viscount Althorp
and Miss Lavinia Bingham, eldest Daughter of Charles
Lord Lucan, March 6, 1781,”<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> which his critic, Wraxall,
calls “one of the most beautiful lyric productions in the
English language, … emulating at once the fame of
Milton and of Gray.”<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> But beyond the strain of personal
sympathy, congenial to the occasion, was a passion
for America, and the prophetic spirit which belongs to
the poet. Lamenting that Freedom and Concord are
repudiated by the sons of Albion, all the Virtues disappear,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Truth, Justice, Reason, Valor, with them fly</div>
<div class="verse">To seek a purer soil, a more congenial sky.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the soil and sky which they seek are of the
Delaware:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Beyond the vast Atlantic deep</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A dome by viewless genii shall be raised,</div>

<div class="verse indent2"><em>Dancing with every Grace and every Muse,</em></div>
<div class="verse"><em>Shall bid the valleys laugh and heavenly beams diffuse.</em>”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Wraxall remarks, that “here, in a fine frenzy of inspiration,”
the poet “seems to behold, as in a vision,
the modern Washington and the Congress met, after
successfully throwing off all subjection to Great Britain,”
while “George the Third is pretty clearly designated
in the line apostrophizing tyrants.”<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> But to an
American the most captivating verses are those which
open the vista of peaceful triumphs, where Commerce
and the Arts unite with every Grace and every Muse.</p>

<p>Kindred in sentiment were other contemporary verses
by the anonymous author of the “Heroic Epistle to Sir
William Chambers,” now understood to be the poet
Mason,<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> which Wraxall praises for their beauty, but
condemns for their politics.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> After describing the corruption
of the House of Commons under Lord North,
the poet declares that it will augment in enormity and
profligacy,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Till, mocked and jaded with the puppet play,</div>
<div class="verse">Old England’s genius turns with scorn away,</div>
<div class="verse">Ascends his sacred bark, the sails unfurled,</div>
<div class="verse"><em>And steers his state to the wide Western World</em>.</div>

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>
<p>The two poets united in a common cause. One transported
to the other side of the Atlantic the virtues
which had been the glory of Britain, and the other
carried there nothing less than the sovereign genius
of the great nation itself.</p>

<h4>COUNT ARANDA, 1783.</h4>

<p>The Count Aranda was one of the first of Spanish
statesmen and diplomatists, and one of the richest subjects
of Spain in his day; born at Saragossa, 1718, and
died 1799. He, too, is one of our prophets. Originally
a soldier, he became ambassador, governor of a province,
and prime-minister. In this last post he displayed
character as well as ability, and was the benefactor of
his country. He drove the Jesuits from Spain, and
dared to oppose the Inquisition. He was a philosopher,
and, like Pope Benedict the Fourteenth, corresponded
with Voltaire. Such a liberal spirit was out of place
in Spain. Compelled to resign in 1773, he found a retreat
at Paris as ambassador, where he came into communication
with Franklin, Adams, and Jay, and finally
signed the Treaty of 1783, by which Spain recognized
our independence. Shortly afterwards he returned to
Spain, and in 1792 took the place of Florida Blanca as
prime-minister for the second time. He was emphatically
a statesman, and as such did not hesitate to take
responsibility even contrary to express orders. An
instance of this civic courage was when, for the sake
of peace between Spain and England, he accepted the
Floridas instead of Gibraltar, on which the eminent
French publicist, M. Rayneval, remarks that “history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
furnishes few examples of such a character and such
self-devotion.”<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p>Franklin, on meeting him, records, in his letter to
the Secret Committee of Correspondence, that he seemed
“well disposed towards us.”<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> Some years afterwards
he had another interview with him, which he thus
chronicles in his journal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Saturday, June 29th</i> [1782].&mdash;We went together to the
Spanish Ambassador’s, who received us with great civility
and politeness. He spoke with Mr. Jay on the subject of
the treaty they were to make together.… On our going
out, he took pains himself to open the folding-doors for us,
which is a high compliment here, and told us he would return
our visit (<i>rendre son devoir</i>), and then fix a day with us
for dining with him.”<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Adams, in his Diary,<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> describes a Sunday dinner at
his house, then a new building in “the finest situation
in Paris,” being part of the incomparable palace, with
its columnar front, still admired as it looks on the Place
de la Concorde. Jay also describes a dinner with the
Count, who was living “in great splendor,” with an “assortment
of wines perhaps the finest in Europe,” and
was “the ablest Spaniard he had ever known”; showing
by his conversation “that his court is in earnest,”
and appearing “frank and candid, as well as sagacious.”<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>
These hospitalities have a peculiar interest, when it is
known, as it now is, that Count Aranda regarded the
acknowledgment of our independence with “grief and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
dread.” But these sentiments were disguised from our
ministers.</p>

<p>After signing the Treaty of Paris, by which Spain recognized
our independence, Aranda addressed a Memoir
secretly to King Charles the Third, in which his opinions
on this event are set forth. This prophetic document
slumbered for a long time in the confidential archives
of the Spanish crown. Coxe, in his “Memoirs
of the Kings of Spain of the House of Bourbon,” which
are founded on a rare collection of original documents,
makes no allusion to it. It was first brought to light
in a French translation of Coxe’s work by Don Andres
Muriel, published at Paris in 1827.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> An abstract of the
Memoir appears in one of the historical dissertations of
the Mexican authority, Alaman, who said of it that it
has “a just celebrity, because results have made it pass
for a prophecy.”<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> I give the material portions, translated
from the French of Muriel.</p>

<p class="hanging">“<i>Memoir communicated secretly to the King by his Excellency
the Count Aranda, on the Independence of the English Colonies,

</div>

<p>“The independence of the English Colonies has been
acknowledged. This is for me an occasion of grief and
dread. France has few possessions in America; but she
should have considered that Spain, her intimate ally, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
many, and that she is left to-day exposed to terrible shocks.
From the beginning, France has acted contrary to her true
interests in encouraging and seconding this independence: I
have often so declared to the ministers of this nation. What
could happen better for France than to see the English and
the Colonists destroy each other in a party warfare which
could only augment her power and favor her interests? The
antipathy which reigns between France and England blinded
the French Cabinet; it forgot that its interest consisted in
remaining a tranquil spectator of this conflict; and, once
launched in the arena, it dragged us, unhappily, and by virtue
of the Family Compact, into a war entirely contrary to
our proper interest.</p>

<p>“I will not stop here to examine the opinions of some
statesmen, our own countrymen as well as foreigners, which
I share, on <em>the difficulty of preserving our power in America.
Never have so extensive possessions, placed at a great distance
from the metropolis, been long preserved.</em> To this cause, applicable
to all colonies, must be added others peculiar to the
Spanish possessions: namely, the difficulty of succoring them,
in case of need; the vexations to which the unhappy inhabitants
have been exposed from some of the governors; the
distance of the supreme authority to which they must have
recourse for the redress of grievances, which causes years to
pass before justice is done to their complaints; the vengeance
of the local authorities to which they continue exposed while
waiting; the difficulty of knowing the truth at so great a
distance; finally, the means which the viceroys and governors,
from being Spaniards, cannot fail to have for obtaining
favorable judgments in Spain: all these different circumstances
will render the inhabitants of America discontented,
and make them attempt efforts to obtain independence as
soon as they shall have a propitious occasion.</p>

<p>“Without entering into any of these considerations, I shall
confine myself now to that which occupies us from the dread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
of seeing ourselves exposed to dangers from the new power
which we have just recognized in a country where there is
no other in condition to arrest its progress. <em>This Federal
Republic is born a pygmy</em>, so to speak. It required the
support and the forces of two powers as great as Spain and
France in order to attain independence. <em>A day will come
when it will be a giant, even a colossus, formidable in these
countries.</em> It will then forget the benefits which it has received
from the two powers, and will dream of nothing but to
aggrandize itself. <em>Liberty of conscience, the facility for establishing
a new population on immense lands, as well as the advantages
of the new government, will draw thither agriculturists
and artisans from all the nations: for men always run after
Fortune. And in a few years we shall see with true grief the
tyrannical existence of this same colossus of which I speak.</em></p>

<p>“The first movement of this power, when it has arrived
at its aggrandizement, will be to obtain possession of the
Floridas, in order to dominate the Gulf of Mexico. After
having rendered commerce with New Spain difficult for us,
it will aspire to the conquest of this vast empire, which it
will not be possible for us to defend against a formidable
power established on the same continent, and in its neighborhood.
These fears are well founded, Sire; they will be
changed into reality in a few years, if, indeed, there are not
other disorders in our Americas still more fatal. This observation
is justified by what has happened in all ages, and
with all nations which have begun to rise. Man is the same
everywhere; the difference of climate does not change the
nature of our sentiments; he who finds the opportunity of
acquiring power and of aggrandizing himself profits by it
always. How, then, can we expect the Americans to respect
the kingdom of New Spain, when they shall have the facility
of possessing themselves of this rich and beautiful country?
A wise policy counsels us to take precautions against evils
which may happen. This thought has occupied my whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
mind, since, as Minister Plenipotentiary of your Majesty, and
conformably to your royal will and instructions, I signed the
Peace of Paris. I have considered this important affair with
all the attention of which I am capable, and, after much reflection,
drawn from the knowledge, military as well as political,
which I have been able to acquire in my long career, I
think, that, in order to escape the great losses with which we
are threatened, there remains nothing but the means which I
am about to have the honor of exhibiting to your Majesty.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty must relieve yourself of all your possessions
on the continent of the two Americas, <em>preserving only
the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico</em> in the northern part, and
some other convenient one in the southern part, to serve as
a seaport or trading-place for Spanish commerce.</p>

<p>“In order to accomplish this great thought in a manner
becoming to Spain, three Infantes must be placed in America,&mdash;one
as king of Mexico, another as king of Peru, and
the third as king of the Terra Firma. Your Majesty will
take the title of Emperor.”</p>

</div>

<p>I have sometimes heard this remarkable Memoir
called apocryphal, but without reason, except because
its foresight is so remarkable. The Mexican historian
Alaman treats it as genuine, and, after praising it, informs
us that the project of Count Aranda was not taken
into consideration, but that “the results have shown
how advantageous it would have been to all, and especially
to the people of America, who in this way would
have obtained independence without revolution and enjoyed
it without anarchy.”<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> Meanwhile all the American
possessions of the Spanish crown, except Cuba and
Porto Rico, have become independent, as predicted, and
the new power, known as the United States, which at
that time was a “pygmy,” is a “colossus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>

<p>In proposing a throne for Spanish America, Aranda
was preceded by no less a person than the great French
engineer and fort-builder, Marshal Vauban, who, during
the reverses of the War of the Spanish Succession, submitted
to the court of France that Philip the Fifth
should be sent to reign in America; and that prince
is said to have consented.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>Aranda was not alone in surprise at the course of
Spain. The English traveller Burnaby, in his edition
of 1798, mentions this as one of the reasons for the
success of the Colonists, and declares that he had not
supposed, originally, “that Spain would join in a plan
inevitably leading, though by slow and imperceptible
steps, to the final loss of all her rich possessions in
South America.”<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> This was not an uncommon idea.
The same anxieties appeared in one of Mr. Adams’s
Dutch correspondents, whose report of fearful prophecies
has been already mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> John Adams also
records in his Diary, under date of 14th December,
1779, on landing at Ferrol in Spain, that, according to
the report of various persons, “the Spanish nation in
general have been of opinion that the Revolution in
America was of bad example to the Spanish colonies,
and dangerous to the interests of Spain, as the United
States, if they should become ambitious, and be seized
with the spirit of conquest, might aim at Mexico and
Peru.”<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> All this is entirely in harmony with the
Memoir of the Spanish statesman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span></p>

<h4>WILLIAM PALEY, 1785.</h4>

<p>With the success of the American Revolution prophecy
entered other spheres, and here we welcome a remarkable
writer, the Rev. William Paley, an English
divine, who was born July, 1743, and died 25th May,
1805. He is known for various works of great contemporary
repute, all commended by a style of singular
transparency, and admirably adapted to the level
of opinion at the time. If they are gradually vanishing
from sight, it is because other works, especially
in philosophy, are more satisfactory and touch higher
chords.</p>

<p>His earliest considerable work, and for a long period
a popular text-book of education, was the well-known
“Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy,” which
first appeared in 1785. Here, with grave errors and a
reprehensible laxity on certain topics, he did much for
truth. The clear vision with which he saw the enormity
of Slavery was not disturbed by any prevailing
interest at home, and he constantly testified against
it. American Independence furnished occasion for a
prophetic aspiration of more than common value, because
embodied in a work of morals especially for the
young:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The great revolution which seems preparing in the Western
World may probably conduce (and who knows but that
it is designed?) <em>to accelerate the fall of this abominable tyranny</em>:
and when this contest, and the passions that attend
it, are no more, there will succeed a season for reflecting
whether a legislature which had so long lent its assistance
to the support of an institution replete with human misery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
was fit to be trusted with an empire the most extensive that
ever obtained in any age or quarter of the world.”<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In thus associating Emancipation with American
Independence, the philosopher became an unconscious
associate of Lafayette, who, on the consummation of
peace, invited Washington to this beneficent enterprise,<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>&mdash;alas!
in vain.</p>

<p>Paley did not confine his testimony to the pages of
philosophy, but openly united with the Abolitionists
of the day. To help the movement against the slave-trade,
he encountered the <em>claim of pecuniary compensation</em>
for the partakers in the traffic, by a brief essay,
in 1789, entitled “Arguments against the Unjust Pretensions
of Slave Dealers and Holders to be indemnified
by Pecuniary Allowances at the Public Expense,
in Case the Slave Trade should be abolished.”<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> This
was sent to the Abolition Committee, by whom the
substance was presented to the public; but unhappily
the essay was lost or mislaid.</p>

<p>His honorable interest in the cause was attested by
a speech at a public meeting of the inhabitants of
Carlisle, over which he presided, 9th February, 1792.
Here he denounced the slave-trade as “this diabolical
traffic,” and by a plain similitude, as applicable to slavery
as to the trade in slaves, held it up to judgment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“None will surely plead in favor of scalping. But suppose
scalps should become of request in Europe, and a trade
in them be carried on with the American Indians; might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
it not be justly said, that the Europeans, by their trade in
scalps, did all they could to perpetuate amongst the natives
of America the inhuman practice of scalping?”<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Strange that the philosopher who extenuated Duelling
should have been so true and lofty against Slavery!
For this, at least, he deserves our grateful praise.</p>

<h4>ROBERT BURNS, 1788.</h4>

<p>From Count Aranda to Robert Burns,&mdash;from the
rich and titled minister, faring sumptuously in the best
house of Paris, to the poor ploughboy poet, struggling
in a cottage,&mdash;what a contrast! And there is contrast
also between him and the philosopher nestling in the
English Church. Of the poet I say nothing, except that
he was born 25th January, 1759, and died 21st July,
1796, in the thirty-eighth year of his age.</p>

<p>There is only a slender thread of Burns to be woven
into this web, and yet, coming from him, it must not be
neglected. In a letter dated 8th November, 1788, after
a friendly word for the unfortunate House of Stuart, he
prophetically alludes to American Independence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I will not, I cannot, enter into the merits of the case, but
I dare say the American Congress in 1776 will be allowed to
be as able and as enlightened as the English Convention was
in 1688, <em>and that their posterity will celebrate the centenary
of their deliverance from us as duly and sincerely as we do
ours from the oppressive measures of the wrong-headed House
of Stuart</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>

<p>The year 1788, when these words were written, was a
year of commemoration, being the hundredth from the
famous Revolution by which the Stuarts were excluded
from the throne of England. The “centenary” of our
Independence is not yet completed; but long ago the
commemoration began. On the coming of that hundredth
anniversary, the prophecy of Burns will be more
than fulfilled.</p>

<p>This aspiration is in harmony with the address to
George the Third in the “Dream,” after the loss of the
Colonies:&mdash;</p>

<h4>RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN, 1794.</h4>

<p>Sheridan was a genius who united the palm of eloquence
in Parliament with that other palm won at the
Theatre. His speeches and his plays excited equal applause.
The House of Commons and Drury Lane were
the scenes of his famous labors, while society enjoyed
his graceful wit. He was born in Dublin, September,
1751, and died in London, July 7th, 1816.</p>

<p>I quote now from a speech in the House of Commons,
21st January, 1794.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“America remains neutral, prosperous, and at peace.
America, with a wisdom, prudence, and magnanimity which
we have disdained, thrives at this moment in a state of
envied tranquillity, and <em>is hourly clearing the paths to unbounded
opulence</em>. America has monopolized the commerce
and the advantages which we have abandoned. Oh! turn
your eyes to her; view her situation, her happiness, her
content; observe her trade and her manufactures, adding
daily to her general credit, to her private enjoyments, and
to her public resources,&mdash;<em>her name and government rising
above the nations of Europe with a simple, but commanding
dignity, that wins at once the respect, the confidence, and the
affection of the world</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here are true respect and sympathy for our country,
with a forecast of increasing prosperity, and an image
of her attitude among the nations. It is pleasant to
enroll the admired author of “The Rivals” and “The
School for Scandal” in this catalogue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<h4>CHARLES JAMES FOX, 1794.</h4>

<p>In quoting from Charles James Fox, the statesman,
minister, and orator, I need add nothing, except that
he was born 24th January, 1749, and died 13th September,
1806, and that he was an early friend of our
country.</p>

<p>Many words of his, especially during our Revolution,
might be introduced here; but I content myself with
a single passage, of later date, which, besides its expression
of good-will, is a prophecy of our power. It
is found in a speech in the House of Commons, on
his motion for putting an end to war with France,
30th May, 1794.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was impossible to dissemble that we had a serious
dispute with America, and although we might be confident
that the wisest and best man of his age, who presided in
the government of that country, would do everything that
became him to avert a war, it was impossible to foresee
the issue. America had no fleet, no army; but in case of
war she would find various means to harass and annoy us.
Against her we could not strike a blow that would not be
as severely felt in London as in America, so identified were
the two countries by commercial intercourse. <em>To a contest
with such an adversary he looked as the greatest possible misfortune.</em>
If we commenced another crusade against her, we
might destroy her trade, and check the progress of her agriculture,
but we must also equally injure ourselves. Desperate,
therefore, indeed, must be that war in which each
wound inflicted on our enemy would at the same time inflict
one upon ourselves. He hoped to God that such an
event as a war with America would not happen.”<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>

<p>All good men on both sides of the ocean must join
with Fox, who thus early deprecated war between the
United States and England, and portrayed the fearful
consequences. Time, which has enlarged and multiplied
the relations between the two countries, makes his
words more applicable now than when first uttered.</p>

<h4>ABBÉ GRÉGOIRE, 1808.</h4>

<p>Henri Grégoire, of France, Curate, Deputy to the
States General, Constitutional Bishop, Member of the
Convention, also of the Council of Five Hundred,
and Senator, sometimes called Bishop, more frequently
Abbé, was born 4th December, 1750, and died 28th
April, 1831. To these titles add Abolitionist and Republican.</p>

<p>His character and career were unique, being in
France what Clarkson and Wilberforce were in England,
and much more, for he was not only an Abolitionist.
In all history no hero of humanity stands
forth more conspicuous for instinctive sympathy with
the Rights of Man and constancy in their support.
As early as 1788 he signalized himself by an essay,
crowned by the Academy of Metz, upholding tolerance
for the Jews.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> His public life began, while yet
a curate, as a representative of the clergy of Lorraine
in the States General, but his sympathies with the
people were at once manifest. In the engraving by
which the oath in the Tennis Court is commemorated
he appears in the foreground. His votes were always
for the enfranchisement of the people and the improvement
of their condition, his hope being “to Christianize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
the Revolution.”<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> In the night session of 4th
August, 1789, he declared for the abolition of privileges.
He was the first to give adhesion to the civil
constitution of the clergy, and himself became a constitutional
bishop. The decree abolishing royalty was
drawn by him, and he avows that for many days thereafter
the excess of joy took from him appetite and
sleep. In the discussion on the execution of the King
he called for the suppression of the punishment of
death. At his instance the Convention abolished African
slavery. With similar energy he sustained public
libraries, botanical gardens, and experimental farms.
He was a founder of the Bureau of Longitudes, the
<em>Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers</em>, and of the National
Institute. More than any other person he contributed
to prevent the destruction of public monuments, and
was the first to call this crime “Vandalism,”&mdash;an excellent
term, since adopted in all European languages.
With similar vigor he said, in words often quoted,
“Kings are in the moral order what monsters are in
the physical order”; and, “The history of kings is the
martyrology of nations.” He denounced “the oligarchs
of all countries and all the crowned brigands who
pressed down the people,” and, according to his own
boast, “spat upon” duellists. “Better a loss to deplore
than an injustice to reproach ourselves with,” was his
lofty solace as he turned from the warning that the
Colonies might be endangered by the rights he demanded.</p>

<p>Such a man could not reconcile himself to the Empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
or to Napoleon; nor could he expect consideration
under the Restoration. But he was constant always
to his original sentiments. In 1826 he wrote a work
with the expressive title, “The Nobility of the Skin, or
the Prejudice of Whites against the Color of Africans
and that of their Black and Mixed Descendants.”<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> His
life was prolonged to witness the Revolution of 1830,
and shortly after his remains were borne to the cemetery
of Mont Parnasse by young men, who took the
horses from the hearse.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p>

<p>This brief account of one little known is an introduction
to signal prophecies concerning America.</p>

<p>As early as 8th January, 1791, in a document addressed
to citizens of color and free negroes of the
French islands, he boldly said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A day will come when deputies of color will traverse
the ocean to come and sit in the national diet, and to swear
with us to live and die under our laws. A day will come
when the sun will not shine among you except upon freemen,&mdash;when
the rays of the light-spreading orb will no
longer fall upon irons and slaves.… It is according to
the irresistible march of events and the progress of intelligence,
that all people dispossessed of the domain of Liberty
will at last recover this indefeasible property.”<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These strong and confident words, so early in date,
were followed by others more remarkable. At the
conclusion of his admirable work “De la Littérature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
des Nègres,” first published in 1808, where, with equal
knowledge and feeling, homage is done to a people
wronged and degraded by man, he cites his prediction
with regard to the sun shining only upon freemen,
and then, elevated by the vision, declares that “this
American Continent, asylum of Liberty, is on its way
towards an order of things which will be common to
the Antilles, and <em>the course of which all the powers
combined will not be able to arrest</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> This vigorous
language is crowned by a prophecy of singular extent
and precision, where, after dwelling on the influences
at work to accelerate progress, he foretells the eminence
of our country:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When an energetic and powerful nation, to which everything
presages high destinies, stretching its arms over
the two oceans, the Atlantic and Pacific, shall dispatch
its vessels from one to the other <em>by a shortened route,&mdash;whether
by cutting the Isthmus of Panama, or by forming a
canal of communication, as has been proposed, by the River
St. John and the Lake of Nicaragua,&mdash;it will change the
face of the commercial world and the face of empires</em>. Who
knows if America will not then avenge the outrages she
has received, and if our old Europe, placed in the rank of
a subaltern power, will not become a colony of the New
World?”<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus resting on the two oceans with a canal between,
so that the early “secret of the strait” shall
no longer exist, the American Republic will change
the face of the world, and perhaps make Europe subaltern.
Such was the vision of the French Abolitionist,

<h4>THOMAS JEFFERSON, 1824.</h4>

<p>Small preface is needed for the testimony of Jefferson,
whose life belongs to the history of his country.
He was born 2d April, 1743, and died 4th July, 1826.</p>

<p>Contemporary and rival of Adams, the author of
the Declaration of Independence surpassed the other
in sympathetic comprehension of the Rights of Man,
as the other surpassed him in the prophetic spirit.
Jefferson’s words picturing Slavery were unequalled in
the prolonged discussion of that terrible subject, and
his two Inaugural Addresses are masterpieces of political
truth. But with clearer eye Adams foresaw the
future grandeur of the Republic, and dwelt on its ravishing
light and glory. The vision of our country coextensive
and coincident with the North American
Continent was never beheld by Jefferson. While recognizing
that our principles of government, traversing
the Rocky Mountains, would smile upon the Pacific
coast, his sight did not embrace the distant communities
there as parts of a common country. This is
apparent in a letter to John Jacob Astor, 24th May,
1812, where, referring to the commencement of a settlement
by the latter on Columbia River, and declaring
the gratification with which he looked forward to the
time when its descendants should have spread through
the whole length of that coast, he adds, “covering it
with free and independent Americans, <em>unconnected with
us but by the ties of blood and interest</em>, and employing,
like us, the rights of self-government.”<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> In another
letter to Mr. Astor, 9th November, 1813, he characterizes
the settlement as “the germ of a great, free, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
<em>independent empire on that side of our continent</em>,”<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> thus
carefully announcing political dissociation.</p>

<p>But Jefferson has not been alone in blindness to the
mighty capabilities of the Republic, inspired by his
own Declaration of Independence. Daniel Webster, in
a speech at Faneuil Hall, as late as 7th November,
1845, pronounced that the Pacific coast could not be
governed from Europe, or from the Atlantic side of
the Continent; and he pressed the absurdity of anything
different:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Where is Oregon? On the shores of the Pacific, three
thousand miles from us, and twice as far from England.
Who is to settle it? Americans mainly; some settlers undoubtedly
from England; but all Anglo-Saxons; all, men
educated in notions of independent government, and all
self-dependent. And now let me ask if there be any sensible
man in the whole United States who will say for a
moment, that, when fifty or a hundred thousand persons
of this description shall find themselves on the shores of
the Pacific Ocean, they will long consent to be under the
rule either of the American Congress or the British Parliament.
They will raise a standard for themselves, and they
ought to do it.”<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such a precise and strenuous protest from such a
quarter mitigates the distrust of Jefferson. But after
the acquisition of California the orator said, “I willingly
admit, my apprehensions have not been realized.”<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

<p>On the permanence of the National Union, and its
influence throughout the world, Jefferson prophesied
thus, in a letter to Lafayette, 14th February, 1815:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The cement of this Union is in the heart-blood of every
American. I do not believe there is on earth a government
established on so immovable a basis. Let them in any State,
even in Massachusetts itself, raise the standard of separation,
and its citizens will rise in mass and do justice themselves
on their own incendiaries.”<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Unhappily the Rebellion shows that he counted too
much on the patriotism of the States against “their
own incendiaries.” In the same hopeful spirit he wrote
to Edward Livingston, the eminent jurist, 4th April,
1824:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You have many years yet to come of vigorous activity,
and I confidently trust they will be employed in cherishing
every measure which may foster our brotherly union and
perpetuate a constitution of government <em>destined to be the
primitive and precious model of what is to change the condition
of man over the globe</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In these latter words he takes his place on the platform
of John Adams, and sees the world changed by
our example. But again he is anxious about the Union.
In another letter to Livingston, 25th March, 1825, after
saying of the National Constitution, that “it is a compact
of many independent powers, every single one of
which claims an equal right to understand it and to
require its observance,” he prophesies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“However strong the cord of compact may be, there is
a point of tension at which it will break.”<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus, in venerable years, while watching with anxiety
the fortunes of the Union, the patriarch did not
fail to see the new order of ages instituted by the
American Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<h4>GEORGE CANNING, 1826.</h4>

<p>George Canning was a successor of Fox, in the
House of Commons, as statesman, minister, and orator.
He was born 11th April, 1770, and died 8th August,
1827, in the beautiful villa of the Duke of Devonshire,
at Chiswick, where Fox had died before. Unlike
Fox in sentiment for our country, he is nevertheless
associated with a leading event of our history, and is
the author of prophetic words.</p>

<p>The Monroe Doctrine, as now familiarly called, proceeded
from Canning. He was its inventor, promoter,
and champion, at least so far as it bears against European
intervention in American affairs. Earnestly engaged
in counteracting the designs of the Holy Alliance
for the restoration of the Spanish colonies to Spain, he
sought to enlist the United States in the same policy;
and when Mr. Rush, our minister at London, replied,
that any interference with European politics was contrary
to the traditions of the American Government,
he argued, that, however just such a policy might have
been formerly, it was no longer applicable,&mdash;that the
question was new and complicated,&mdash;that it was “full
as much American as European, to say no more,”&mdash;that
“it concerned the United States under aspects and
interests as immediate and commanding as it did or
could any of the States of Europe,”&mdash;that “they were
the first power established on that continent, and now
confessedly the leading power”; and he then asked:
“Was it possible that they could see with indifference
their fate decided upon by Europe?… Had not a
new epoch arrived in the relative position of the United
States towards Europe, which Europe must acknowledge?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
<em>Were the great political and commercial interests</em>
which hung upon the destinies of the new continent
to be canvassed and adjusted in this hemisphere, without
the coöperation, or even knowledge, of the United
States?”<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> With mingled ardor and importunity the
British Minister pressed his case. At last, after much
discussion in the Cabinet at Washington, President
Monroe, accepting the lead of Mr. Canning, and with
the counsel of John Quincy Adams, put forth his
famous declaration, where, after referring to the radical
difference between the political systems of Europe
and America, he says, that “we should consider any
attempt on their part to extend their system to any
portion of this hemisphere as <em>dangerous to our peace
and safety</em>,” and that, where governments have been
recognized by us as independent, “we could not view
any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them,
or controlling in any other manner their destiny, by
any European power, in any other light than as <em>the
manifestation of an unfriendly disposition towards the
United States</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></p>

<p>The message of President Monroe was received in
England with enthusiastic congratulations. It was upon
all tongues; the press was full of it; the securities
of Spanish America rose in the market; the agents of
Spanish America were happy.<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> Brougham exclaimed in
Parliament, that “no event had ever dispersed greater
joy, exultation, and gratitude over all the freemen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
Europe.”<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> Mackintosh rejoiced in the coincidence of
England and the United States, “the two great English
commonwealths,&mdash;for so he delighted to call them; and
he heartily prayed that they might be forever united
in the cause of justice and liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> The Holy Alliance
abandoned their purposes on this continent, and
the independence of Spanish America was established.
Some time afterwards, on the occasion of assistance to
Portugal, when Mr. Canning felt called to review and
vindicate his foreign policy, he assumed the following
lofty strain: this was in the House of Commons, 12th
December, 1826:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It would be disingenuous not to admit that the entry
of the French army into Spain was, in a certain sense, a
disparagement, an affront to the pride, a blow to the feelings
of England.… But I deny, that, questionable or censurable
as the act might be, it was one which necessarily
called for our direct and hostile opposition. Was nothing,
then, to be done?… If France occupied Spain, was it
necessary, in order to avoid the consequences of that occupation,
that we should blockade Cadiz? No. I looked another
way. I sought materials of compensation in another hemisphere.
Contemplating Spain, such as our ancestors had
known her, I resolved, that, if France had Spain, it should
not be Spain ‘with the Indies.’ <em>I called the New World into
existence, to redress the balance of the Old.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>

</div>

<p>If the republics of Spanish America, thus summoned
into independent existence, have not contributed the
weight thus vaunted, the growing power of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
States is ample to compensate deficiencies on this continent.
There is no balance of power it cannot redress.</p>

<h4>ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE, 1835.</h4>

<p>With De Tocqueville we come among contemporaries
removed by death. He was born at Paris, 29th July,
1805, and died at Cannes, 16th April, 1859. Having
known him personally, and seen him at his castle-home
in Normandy, I cannot fail to recognize the man
in his writings, which on this account have a double
charm.</p>

<p>He was the younger son of noble parents, his father
being of ancient Norman descent, and his mother granddaughter
of Malesherbes, the venerated defender of Louis
the Sixteenth; but his aristocratic birth had no influence
to check the generous sympathies with which his
heart always palpitated. In 1831 he came to America
as a commissioner from the French Government to examine
our prisons, but with a larger commission from
his own soul to study republican institutions. His conscientious
application, rare probity, penetrating thought,
and refinement of style all appeared in his work, “De
la Démocratie en Amérique,” first published in 1835,
whose peculiar success is marked by the fourteenth
French edition now before me, and the translations into
other languages. At once he was famous, and his work
classical. The Academy opened its gates. Since Montesquieu
there had been no equal success in the same
department, and he was constantly likened to the illustrious
author of “The Spirit of Laws.” Less epigrammatic,
less artful, and less French than his prototype,
he was more simple, truthful, and prophetic. A second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
publication in 1840, with the same title, the fruit of
mature studies, presented American institutions in another
aspect, exhibiting his unimpaired faith in Democracy,
which with him was Equality as “first principle
and symbol.”<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a></p>

<p>Entering the French Chambers, he became eminent
for character, discussing chiefly those measures in which
civilization is most concerned,&mdash;the reform of prisons,
the abolition of slavery, penal colonies, and the pretensions
of socialism. His work, “L’Ancien Régime et la
Révolution,” awakens admiration, while his correspondence
is among the most charming in literature, exciting
love as well as delight.</p>

<p>His honest and practical insight made him philosopher
and prophet, which he was always. A speech
in the Chambers, 27th January, 1848, was memorable
as predicting the Revolution which occurred one month
later. But his foresight with regard to America brings
him into our procession.</p>

<p>His clearness of vision appears in the distinctness
with which he recognized the peril from Slavery and
from the pretensions of the States. And in Slavery
he saw also the prolonged and diversified indignity to
the African race. This was his statement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The most formidable of all the evils which menace the
future of the United States springs from <em>the presence of the
blacks on their soil</em>. When we seek the cause of the present
embarrassments and of the future dangers of the Union,
from whatever point we set out, we almost always come
upon this primary fact.”<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>

<p>Then with consummate power he depicts the lot
of the unhappy African, even when free: oppressed,
but with whites for judges; shut out from the jury;
his son excluded from the school which receives the
descendant of the European; unable with gold to buy
a place at the theatre “by the side of him who was
his master”; in hospitals separated from the rest; permitted
to worship the same God as the whites, but
not to pray at the same altar; and when life is passed,
the difference of condition prevailing still even over
the equality of the grave.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></p>

<p>Impressed by the menace from Slavery, he further
pictures the Union succumbing to the States:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Either I strangely deceive myself, or the Federal Government
of the United States is tending every day to grow
weaker. It is withdrawing gradually from affairs; it is contracting
more and more the circle of its action. Naturally
feeble, it is abandoning even the appearance of force.”<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such was the condition when De Tocqueville wrote;
and so it continued until the Rebellion broke forth, and
the country rose to save the Union. Foreseeing this
peril, he did not despair of the Republic, which, in his
judgment, was “the natural state of the Americans,”<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>
with roots more profound than the Union.</p>

<p>In describing the future he becomes a prophet. Accepting
the conclusion that the number of inhabitants
doubles in twenty-two years, and not recognizing any
causes to arrest this progressive movement, he foresees
the colossal empire:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Americans of the United States, whatever they do,
will become one of the greatest people of the world; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
will cover with their offshoots almost all North America.
The continent which they inhabit is their domain; it cannot
escape them.”<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then, declaring that the “English race,” not stopping
within the limits of the Union, will advance much beyond
towards the Northeast,&mdash;that at the Northwest
they will encounter only Russian settlements without
importance,&mdash;that at the Southwest the vast solitudes
of Mexican territory will be appropriated,&mdash;and dwelling
on the fortunate geographical position of “the English
of America,” with their climate, their interior seas,
their great rivers, and the fertility of their soil, he is
ready to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So, in the midst of the uncertainty of the future, there
is at least one event which is certain. At an epoch which
we can call near, since the question here is of the life of
a people, the Anglo-Americans alone will cover all the immense
space comprised between the polar ice and the tropics;
they will spread from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean even
to the coasts of the South Sea.”<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then, declaring that the territory destined to the
Anglo-American race equals three fourths of Europe,
that many centuries will pass before the different offshoots
of this race will cease to present a common
physiognomy, that no epoch can be foreseen when in
the New World there will be any permanent inequality
of conditions, and that there are processes of association
and of knowledge by which the people are
assimilated with each other and with the rest of the
world, the prophet speaks:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There will then come a time when there will be seen
in North America one hundred and fifty millions of men,
equal among themselves, who will all belong to the same
family, who will have the same point of departure, the same
civilization, the same language, the same religion, the same
habits, the same manners, and among whom thought will circulate
in the same form and paint itself in the same colors.
All else is doubtful, but this is certain. Now here is a
fact entirely new in the world, of which imagination itself
cannot grasp the import.”<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></p>

</div>

<p>No American can fail to be strengthened in the future
of the Republic by the testimony of De Tocqueville.
Honor and gratitude to his memory!</p>

<h4>RICHARD COBDEN, 1849.</h4>

<p>Coming yet nearer to our own day, we meet a
familiar name, now consecrated by death,&mdash;Richard
Cobden, born 3d June, 1804, and died 2d April, 1865.
In proportion as truth prevails among men, his character
will shine with increasing glory until he is recognized
as the first Englishman of his time. Though
thoroughly English, he was not insular. He served
mankind as well as England.</p>

<p>His masterly faculties and his real goodness made
him a prophet always. He saw the future, and strove
to hasten its promises. The elevation and happiness of
the human family were his daily thought. He knew
how to build as well as to destroy. Through him disabilities
upon trade and oppressive taxes were overturned;
also a new treaty was negotiated with France,
quickening commerce and intercourse. He was never
so truly eminent as when bringing his practical sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
and enlarged experience to commend the cause of Permanent
Peace in the world by the establishment of a
refined system of International Justice, and the disarming
of the nations. To this great consummation
all his later labors tended. I have before me a long
letter, dated at London, 7th November, 1849, where he
says much on this absorbing question, from which, by
an easy transition, he passes to speak of the proposed
annexation of Canada to the United States. As what
he says on the latter topic concerns America, and is a
prophetic voice, I have obtained permission to copy it
for this collection.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Race, religion, language, traditions, are becoming bonds
of union, and not the parchment title-deeds of sovereigns.
These instincts may be thwarted for the day, but they are
too deeply rooted in Nature and in usefulness not to prevail
in the end. I look with less interest to these struggles of
races to live apart for what they want to undo than for
what they will prevent being done in future. <em>They will
warn rulers that henceforth the acquisition of fresh territory
by force of arms will only bring embarrassments and civil war</em>,
instead of that increased strength which in ancient times,
when people were passed, like flocks of sheep, from one king
to another, always accompanied the incorporation of new territorial
conquests.</p>

<p>“This is the secret of the admitted doctrine, that we shall
have no more wars of conquest or ambition. In this respect
<em>you</em> are differently situated, having vast tracts of unpeopled
territory to tempt that cupidity which, in respect of landed
property, always disposes individuals and nations, however
rich in acres, to desire more. This brings me to the subject
of Canada, to which you refer in your letters.</p>

<p>“I agree with you, that <i>Nature has decided that Canada
and the United States must become one, for all purposes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
free intercommunication</i>. Whether they also shall be united
in the same federal government must depend upon the two
parties to the union. I can assure you that there will be
no repetition of the policy of 1776, on our part, to prevent
our North American colonies from pursuing their interest
in their own way. If the people of Canada are tolerably
unanimous in wishing to sever the very slight thread which
now binds them to this country, I see no reason why, if
good faith and ordinary temper be observed, it should not
be done amicably. I think it would be far more likely to
be accomplished peaceably, <em>if the subject of annexation were
left as a distinct question</em>. I am quite sure that <em>we</em> should
be gainers, to the amount of about a million sterling annually,
if our North American colonists would set up in life
for themselves and maintain their own establishments; and
I see no reason to doubt that they also might be gainers by
being thrown upon their own resources.</p>

<p>“The less your countrymen mingle in the controversy,
the better. It will only be an additional obstacle in the
path of those in this country who see the ultimate necessity
of a separation, but who have still some ignorance and
prejudice to contend against, which, if used as political capital
by designing politicians, may complicate seriously a very
difficult piece of statesmanship. It is for you and such as
you, who love peace, to guide your countrymen aright in
this matter. You have made the most noble contributions
of any modern writer to the cause of Peace; and as a public
man I hope you will exert all your influence to induce
Americans to hold a dignified attitude and observe a ‘masterly
inactivity’ in the controversy which is rapidly advancing
to a solution between the mother country and her
American colonies.”</p>

</div>

<p>A prudent patriotism among us will appreciate the
wisdom of this counsel, more needed now than when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
written. The controversy which Cobden foresaw “between
the mother country and her American colonies”
is yet undetermined. The recent creation of what is
somewhat grandly called “The Dominion of Canada”
marks one stage in its progress.</p>

<h4>LUCAS ALAMAN, 1852.</h4>

<p>From Canada I pass to Mexico, and close this list
with Lucas Alaman, the Mexican statesman and historian,
who has left on record a most pathetic prophecy
with regard to his own country, intensely interesting
to us at this moment.</p>

<p>Alaman was born in the latter part of the last century,
and died June 2, 1855. He was a prominent
leader of the monarchical party, and Minister of Foreign
Affairs under Presidents Bustamente and Santa
Aña. In this capacity he inspired the respect of foreign
diplomatists. One of these, who had occasion to know
him officially, says of him, in answer to my inquiries,
that he “was the greatest statesman Mexico has produced
since her independence.”<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> He was one of the
few in any country who have been able to unite literature
with public life, and obtain honors in each.</p>

<p>His first work was “Dissertations on the History of
the Mexican Republic,”<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> in three volumes, published at
Mexico, 1844-49. In these he considers the original
conquest by Cortés, its consequences, the conqueror and
his family, the propagation of the Christian religion in
New Spain, the formation of the city of Mexico, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
history of Spain and the House of Bourbon. All these
topics are treated somewhat copiously. Then followed
the “History of Mexico, from the First Movements
which prepared its Independence in 1808 to the Present
Epoch,”<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> in five volumes, published at Mexico, the
first bearing date 1849, and the fifth 1852. From the
Preface to the first volume it appears that the author
was born in Guanajuato, and witnessed there the beginning
of the Mexican Revolution in 1810, under Don
Miguel Hidalgo, the curate of Dolores; that he was
personally acquainted with the curate, and with many
who had a principal part in the successes of that time;
that he was experienced in public affairs, as Deputy
and as member of the Cabinet; and that he had known
directly the persons and things of which he wrote. His
last volume embraces the government of Iturbide as
Emperor, and also his unfortunate death, ending with
the establishment of the Mexican Federal Republic, in
1824. The work is careful and well considered. The
eminent diplomatist already mentioned, who had known
the author officially, writes that “no one was better
acquainted with the history and causes of the incessant
revolutions in his unfortunate country, and that his
work on this subject is considered by all respectable
men in Mexico a <i>chef-d’œuvre</i> for purity of sentiments
and patriotic convictions.”</p>

<p>It is on account of the valedictory words of this History
that I introduce the name of Alaman, and nothing
more striking appears in this gallery. Behold!&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mexico will be, without doubt, a land of prosperity
from its natural advantages, <i>but it will not be so for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
races which now inhabit it</i>. As it seemed the destiny of the
peoples who established themselves therein at different and
remote epochs to perish from the face of it, leaving hardly
a memory of their existence; even as the nation which built
the edifices of Palenque, and those which we admire in the
peninsula of Yucatan, was destroyed without its being known
what it was or how it disappeared; <em>even as the Toltecs perished
by the hands of barbarous tribes coming from the North</em>,
no record of them remaining but the pyramids of Cholula
and Teotihuacan; and, finally, even as the ancient Mexicans
fell beneath the power of the Spaniards, <em>the country gaining
infinitely by this change of dominion, but its ancient masters
being overthrown</em>;&mdash;so likewise its present inhabitants shall
be ruined and hardly obtain the compassion they have merited,
and the Mexican nation of our days shall have applied
to it what a celebrated Latin poet said of one of the
most famous personages of Roman history, STAT MAGNI
NOMINIS UMBRA,<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>&mdash;Nothing more remains than the
shadow of a name illustrious in another time.</p>

<p>“May the Almighty, in whose hands is the fate of nations,
and who by ways hidden from our sight abases or exalts
them according to the designs of His providence, be pleased
to grant unto ours the protection by which He has so often
deigned to preserve it from the dangers to which it has been
exposed!”<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Most affecting words of prophecy! Considering the
character of the author as statesman and historian, it
could have been only with inconceivable anguish that
he made this terrible record for the land whose child
and servant he was. Born and reared in Mexico, honored
by its important trusts, and writing the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
of its independence, it was his country, having for
him all that makes country dear; and yet thus calmly
he consigns the present people to oblivion, while another
enters into those happy places where Nature is
so bountiful. And so a Mexican leaves the door open
to the foreigner.</p>

<h4>CONCLUSION.</h4>

<p>Such are prophetic voices, differing in character and
importance, but all having one augury, and opening one
vista, illimitable in extent and vastness. Farewell to
the narrow thought of Montesquieu, that a republic can
exist only in a small territory!<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> Through representation
and federation a continent is not too much for
practical dominion, nor is it beyond expectation. Well
did Webster say, “The prophecies and the poets are
with us”; and then again, “In regard to this country
there is no poetry like the poetry of events, and all
the prophecies lag behind their fulfilment.”<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> But my
purpose is not with the fulfilment, except as it stands
forth visible to all.</p>

<p>Ancient prophecy foretold another world beyond the
ocean, which in the mind of Christopher Columbus was
nothing less than the Orient with its inexhaustible
treasures. The continent was hardly known when the
prophets began: poets like Chapman, Drayton, Daniel,
Herbert, Cowley; economists like Child and Davenant;
New-Englanders like Morrell, Ward, and Sewall; and,
mingling with these, that rare genius, Sir Thomas
Browne, who, in the reign of Charles the Second, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
the settlements were in infancy, predicted their growth
in power and civilization; and then that rarest character,
Bishop Berkeley, who, in the reign of George the
First, while the settlements were still feeble and undeveloped,
heralded a Western empire as “Time’s noblest
offspring.”</p>

<p>These voices are general. Others more precise followed.
Turgot, the philosopher and minister, saw in
youth, with the vision of genius, that all colonies must
at their maturity drop from the parent stem, like ripe
fruit. John Adams, one of the chiefs of our own
history, in a youth illumined as that of Turgot, saw
the predominance of the Colonies in population and
power, followed by the transfer of empire to America;
then the glory of Independence, and its joyous celebration
by grateful generations; then the triumph of our
language; and, finally, the establishment of our republican
institutions over all North America. Then came
the Abbé Galiani, the Neapolitan Frenchman, who,
writing from Naples while our struggle was still undecided,
gayly predicts the total downfall of Europe,
the transmigration to America, and the consummation
of the greatest revolution of the globe by establishing
the reign of America over Europe. There is also Adam
Smith, the illustrious philosopher, who quietly carries
the seat of government across the Atlantic. Meanwhile
Pownall, once a Colonial governor and then a
member of Parliament, in successive works of great detail,
foreshadows independence, naval supremacy, commercial
prosperity, immigration from the Old World,
and a new national life, destined to supersede the
systems of Europe and arouse the “curses” of royal
ministers. Hartley, also a member of Parliament, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
the British negotiator who signed the definitive treaty
of Independence, bravely announces in Parliament that
the New World is before the Colonists, and that liberty
is theirs; and afterwards, as diplomatist, instructs his
Government, that, through the attraction of our public
lands, immigration will be quickened beyond precedent,
and the national debt cease to be a burden. Aranda,
the Spanish statesman and diplomatist, predicts to his
king that the United States, though born a “pygmy,”
will some day be a “colossus,” under whose influence
Spain will lose all her American possessions except
only Cuba and Porto Rico. Paley, the philosopher,
hails our successful revolution as destined to accelerate
the fall of Slavery, which he denounces as an “abominable
tyranny.” Burns, the truthful poet, who loved
mankind, looks forward a hundred years, and beholds
our people rejoicing in the centenary of their independence.
Sheridan pictures our increasing prosperity, and
the national dignity winning the respect, confidence,
and affection of the world. Fox, the liberal statesman,
foresees the increasing might and various relations of
the United States, so that a blow aimed at them must
have a rebound as destructive as itself. The Abbé Grégoire,
devoted to the slave, whose freedom he predicts,
describes the power and glory of the American Republic,
resting on the two great oceans, and swaying the
world. Tardily, Jefferson appears with anxiety for the
National Union, and yet announcing our government
as the primitive and precious model to change the condition
of mankind. Canning, the brilliant orator, in
a much-admired flight of eloquence, discerns the New
World, with its republics just called into being, redressing
the balance of the Old. De Tocqueville, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
clearly foreseeing the peril from Slavery, proclaims the
future grandeur of the Republic, covering “almost all
North America,” and making the continent its domain,
with a population, equal in rights, counted by the
hundred million. Cobden, whose fame will be second
only to that of Adam Smith among all in this catalogue,
calmly predicts the separation of Canada from
the mother country by peaceable means. Alaman, the
Mexican statesman and historian, announces that Mexico,
which has already known so many successive races;
will hereafter be ruled by yet another people, taking
the place of the present possessors; and with these prophetic
words, the patriot draws a pall over his country.</p>

<p>All these various voices, of different times and lands,
mingle and intertwine in representing the great future
of our Republic, which from small beginnings has already
become great. It was at first only a grain of
mustard-seed, “which, indeed, is the least of all seeds;
but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs,
and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come
and lodge in the branches thereof.” Better still, it was
only a little leaven, but it is fast leavening the whole
continent. Nearly all who have prophesied speak of
“America” or “North America,” and not of any limited
circle, colony, or state. It was so, at the beginning,
with Sir Thomas Browne, and especially with Berkeley.
During our Revolution, the Colonies struggling for independence
were always described by this continental
designation. They were already “America,” or “North
America,” (and such was the language of Washington,)
thus incidentally foreshadowing that coming time when
the whole continent, with all its various states, shall be
a Plural Unit, with one Constitution, one Liberty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
one Destiny. The theme was also taken up by the
poet, and popularized in the often quoted lines,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“No pent-up Utica contracts your powers,</div>
<div class="verse">But the whole boundless continent is yours.”<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such grandeur may justly excite anxiety rather than
pride, for duties are in corresponding proportion. There
is occasion for humility also, as the individual considers
his own insignificance in the transcendent mass.
The tiny polyp, in unconscious life, builds the everlasting
coral. Each citizen is little more than the
industrious insect. The result is reached by the continuity
of combined exertion. Millions of citizens,
working in obedience to Nature, can accomplish anything.</p>

<p>Of course, war is an instrumentality which true civilization
disowns. Here some of our prophets have
erred. Sir Thomas Browne was so much overshadowed
by his own age, that his vision was darkened by “great
armies,” and even “hostile and piratical assault” on
Europe. It was natural that Aranda, schooled in
worldly life, should imagine the new-born power ready
to seize the Spanish possessions. Among our own
countrymen, Jefferson looked to war for the extension
of dominion. The Floridas, he says on one occasion,
“are ours in the first moment of the first war, and until
a war they are of no particular necessity to us.”<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> Happily
they were acquired in another way. Then again,
while declaring that no constitution was ever before so
calculated as ours for extensive empire and self-government,
and insisting upon Canada as a component<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
part, he calmly says that this “would be, of course, in
the first war.”<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> Afterwards, while confessing a longing
for Cuba, “as the most interesting addition which could
ever be made to our system of States,” he says that he
is “sensible that this can never be obtained, even with
her own consent, but by war.”<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> Thus at each stage is
the baptism of blood. In much better mood the poet
Bishop recognized empire as moving gently in the pathway
of light. All this is much clearer now than when
he prophesied.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that empire obtained by force is
unrepublican, and offensive to the first principle of our
Union, according to which all just government stands
only on the consent of the governed. Our country
needs no such ally as war. Its destiny is mightier
than war. Through peace it will have everything.
This is our talisman. Give us peace, and population
will increase beyond all experience; resources of all
kinds will multiply infinitely; arts will embellish the
land with immortal beauty; the name of Republic will
be exalted, until every neighbor, yielding to irresistible
attraction, seeks new life in becoming part of the
great whole; and the national example will be more
puissant than army or navy for the conquest of the
world.</p>

of the letter <i>h</i> in Oon<i>alaska</i> seemed to show the better and more
natural spelling. The following communication, more than a year after
the Speech, was in answer to an inquiry about the spelling with an <i>i</i>, as
Al<i>i</i>aska, which was adopted by several journals.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>, May 8, 1868.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Barney</span>,&mdash;I have your note of the 8th in reference to the spelling of
Alaska.</p>

<p>“I think ‘Aliaska’ is a mistake, for which the Coast Survey, in the first map of
this country, are partly responsible. On inquiry, I found there was no particular
authority for this spelling, and at my suggestion it was altered to Alaska in a subsequent
edition.</p>

<p>“When called to consider the purchase of this territory, I found that it had the
general name of ‘Russian Possessions in America,’ or ‘Russian America.’ In the
event of transfer to the United States, this was evidently improper. Looking for a
name, my attention was arrested by the designation of the promontory stretching
to the Aleutian Islands, called by Captain Cook, the first Englishman who visited
the region, Alaska, without an <i>i</i>, as the large and neighboring island was called
Oon<i>alaska</i>. This is the first time, so far as I am aware, that the name appears.
Though at a later day it was sometimes written ‘Aliaska,’ it seemed to me that
the earlier designation was historically more just, while in itself a better word. On
this account, at the close of my speech I ventured to propose it as a name for the
whole country.</p>

<p>“While I was doing this in Washington, General Halleck, in San Francisco, was
writing an elaborate letter to the Government about the new territory, in which
he proposed the same name, with, as I understand, the same spelling.</p>

<p class="sig">“Yours truly,</p>

<p class="sig2">“<span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent medium">“<span class="smcap">Hon. Hiram Barney</span>, New York.”</p>

</div>

<p>A new edition of the map appeared with the pamphlet edition of the
Speech, on which Mr. Hilgard, of the Coast Survey, in a letter dated May
25th, wrote to Mr. Sumner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As this edition will make its first appearance appended to your speech, I have
ventured to put on it the name Alaska, proposed by you, as I have no doubt it
will be generally adopted.”</p>

days later, a vehement Philippic, where, among other things, he said:
“The Senator from Massachusetts himself has been complicated in the
crime of treason” (alluding to his opposition to the Fugitive Slave Bill).…
“Massachusetts now is in high feather. Why? She feels conscious
and proud that the Constitution of the United States is prostrate at her
feet, and that she is leading the whole Radical host of America to execute
her wild, oppressive, and unconstitutional behests.… The Senator from
Massachusetts pretends to be a statesman, and gets up to speak in this
Chamber, not only to the Senate, not only to the people of the United
States, but to the legislators and statesmen and publicists of Europe, …
as if he fancied himself the autocratic lawgiver of the whole land,&mdash;as
though he was a great Colossus in wisdom and power, bestriding Government,
Constitution, and country.… The people of the South are enslaved;
they are enslaved by the usurped power of the Senator from Massachusetts,
in part, and he knows it.… If justice could overtake the
States of this Union, Massachusetts would be reconstructed and brought
to greater shame than even South Carolina. The honorable Senator was
almost in an ecstasy, a few days ago, when he foretold the advent of
negro Senators into this body. He was jubilant.… We see the fell purpose
of the honorable Senator from Massachusetts. We know with what
persistence he pursues his objects.” Mr. Sumner, in reply, simply read
extracts from speeches by Judge Goodloe, Willard Davis, G. H. Graham,
and General Brisbin, all of Kentucky, at a recent celebration, on the 4th
of July, at Lexington, in that State.[A]</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
